<p>It looks like you're requesting a summary or update of the development related to Kosmion as of October 12th. Based on the most recent updates and your relator-based approach, here are some key details from the development of Kosmion up to this point:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Relator-Based Approach</strong>: You’ve settled on using a relator-based structure, where predicates become classes, and specific predicate instances become expressions of those classes. This allows for greater flexibility in modeling relationships, and you’re considering avoiding OWL Full for now while continuing to refine the approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Immutability &#x26; Bitemporality</strong>: You’ve moved towards making Kosmion immutable with bitemporality using both 'system-time' (aka 'transaction-time') and 'valid-time' for temporal modeling. You're exploring the idea of system-time as external metadata that governs immutability, while valid-time is treated as internal data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Naming and Metadata</strong>: You've been working on a naming convention, leaning towards terms like 'genesis' and 'tombstone' (or 'relator-genesis' and 'relator-tombstone') to represent the birth and death of statements, and preferring 'relator-' as a prefix for metadata. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Slash-Based IRIs</strong>: You're using slash-based IRIs for the Kosmion ontology, establishing a namespace (<code>https://kosmion.github.io/ont/v0/</code>) to structure the ontology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metadata vs. Data</strong>: You clarified that metadata will not use relators. For example, class membership like <code>:Person1 a :Person</code> would be treated as metadata and not included in the relator framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Facets and Aspects</strong>: There’s a developing idea where facets (singular properties) might contribute to aspects (emergent properties), but this is still in the exploratory phase for future discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Versioning Strategy</strong>: You are working on a versioning strategy for handling changes to the ontology, where typo corrections or mistakes would be classified as PATCH changes, adding new data would be MINOR, and changing existing data would be considered a MAJOR update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Redundant Data</strong>: You are considering duplicating relators from relator datasets into the corresponding entity datasets, favoring redundancy to enable consistency checks and smoother attribute management.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're looking for more specific details about progress from that date or an update on particular parts of development, let me know!</p>

<p>Got it! Replacing class membership with facets and/or aspects could give more flexibility, especially if emergent properties can dynamically represent membership or classification based on context. Using relators for class hierarchies within Kosmion also sounds interesting—it could open up new ways of expressing relationships between classes. If you find that relators streamline this kind of hierarchy without losing semantic clarity, it could unify the modeling approach.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any aspect of this transition or explore how relators might fit into class hierarchies.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-dolce-use-relators-aka-reified-relations">How does dolce use relators, aka reified relations.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-does-dolce-use-relators-aka-reified-relations"></a></h2>
<p>In DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering), relators (also known as reified relations) are a key concept used to model complex relationships between entities. Here's how DOLCE approaches relators and reified relations:</p>
<h3 id="relators-in-dolce">Relators in DOLCE:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#relators-in-dolce"></a></h3>
<p>A <strong>relator</strong> in DOLCE is an entity that mediates or relates two or more other entities (called "relata"). Instead of using a simple direct relation between two entities (like a binary predicate), DOLCE uses relators to represent more complex situations where additional contextual information or properties about the relationship itself are needed. This is often referred to as <strong>reified relations</strong> because the relationship is treated as a first-class entity (a relator) in the ontology.</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-relators">Structure of Relators:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#structure-of-relators"></a></h3>
<p>In DOLCE, a relator relates multiple entities by connecting them through <strong>roles</strong>. Each entity involved in the relation plays a specific role. The roles themselves are also explicitly modeled as individuals in the ontology.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relator</strong>: An abstract object that represents the relationship as a first-class entity.</li>
<li><strong>Roles</strong>: Define the part that each related entity plays in the relationship. Each role is connected to the relator.</li>
<li><strong>Mediated entities (relata)</strong>: The entities that the relator connects through their respective roles.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example">Example:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example"></a></h3>
<p>Let’s say we have a <strong>marriage</strong> relationship between two people. In DOLCE:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>marriage</strong> would be represented by a relator (i.e., the marriage itself is an entity).</li>
<li>Each spouse would be connected to the marriage relator by a <strong>role</strong> (e.g., "spouse role").</li>
<li>The actual individuals (the spouses) are the entities that play these roles.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, the <strong>marriage relator</strong> connects the two individuals through their roles as spouses. This allows for adding more detailed information to the marriage (e.g., start date, location, legal status) that would be difficult to represent with just a direct relation between two individuals.</p>
<h3 id="formalization">Formalization:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#formalization"></a></h3>
<p>In DOLCE, relators are formalized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>relator</strong> is a subtype of <strong>non-physical endurant</strong> (meaning it is something that persists over time but is not physical).</li>
<li>Relators require at least two <strong>roles</strong> to be associated with them, and each role must be connected to an entity that participates in the relationship.</li>
<li>A role mediates between the relator and the specific entities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-concepts-in-dolce">Key Concepts in DOLCE:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#key-concepts-in-dolce"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Endurants</strong>: Persistent entities, including physical and non-physical ones.</li>
<li><strong>Perdurants</strong>: Events or processes that occur in time (which can also be related via relators).</li>
<li><strong>Roles</strong>: Functions or parts played by entities in the context of a relator.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-relators">Why Relators?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-relators"></a></h3>
<p>Relators in DOLCE enable a more detailed and flexible modeling of relationships:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Contextual Information</strong>: By treating relationships as entities, you can attach information directly to the relationship (e.g., temporal, spatial, or contextual properties).</li>
<li><strong>Higher-order Relations</strong>: Relators can mediate more than two entities, making them useful for complex n-ary relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit Role Representation</strong>: By representing roles explicitly, DOLCE ensures clarity in how entities participate in a relationship.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="comparison-with-kosmion">Comparison with Kosmion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#comparison-with-kosmion"></a></h3>
<p>In your <strong>Kosmion ontology</strong>, the use of relators seems aligned with DOLCE’s approach, where relators represent relationships between entities via roles. If you consider facets or aspects for class membership, relators could also manage the dynamics of how entities play certain roles, without committing to rigid class structures. If you decide to use relators for class hierarchies, you might model class relationships similarly to how DOLCE handles roles between entities and relators, giving you a way to represent evolving or contextualized classifications.</p>
<p>Would this approach fit with your current direction for Kosmion? Let me know if you want to explore how these ideas might map onto your ontology!</p>
<h2 id="yes-i-think-it-fits-one-difference-weve-talked-about-kosmion-would-use-relators-even-for-unary-relationships">Yes, I think it fits. One difference we've talked about: Kosmion would use relators even for unary relationships.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#yes-i-think-it-fits-one-difference-weve-talked-about-kosmion-would-use-relators-even-for-unary-relationships"></a></h2>
<p>Great! That distinction makes sense, especially if you're aiming for a consistent and flexible way to represent all kinds of relationships, including unary ones, with relators. This could give you more power to manage the context and evolution of even simple relationships, treating them with the same depth as more complex ones. </p>
<p>Let me know if you'd like to explore examples of how Kosmion could handle unary relators, or if you want to work out any specific cases!</p>
<h2 id="assuming-a-file-based-repository-of-rdf-data-could-every-file-be-considered-a-dataset">Assuming a file-based repository of RDF data, could every file be considered a dataset?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#assuming-a-file-based-repository-of-rdf-data-could-every-file-be-considered-a-dataset"></a></h2>
<p>Yes, in a file-based repository of RDF data, every file can be considered a <strong>dataset</strong> depending on how you want to organize and conceptualize the data.</p>
<p>In RDF terms, a <strong>dataset</strong> generally consists of a collection of <strong>graphs</strong>, which may include a <strong>default graph</strong> and any number of <strong>named graphs</strong>. Here’s how it could map to a file-based system:</p>
<h3 id="case-1-single-graph-per-file-simplest-case">Case 1: Single Graph Per File (Simplest Case)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#case-1-single-graph-per-file-simplest-case"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>One file = One graph</strong>: If each RDF file contains a single graph (whether a default graph or a named graph), then the file can be treated as a standalone dataset. This is common when dealing with smaller or more isolated datasets.</li>
<li><strong>Named Graph</strong>: You could define the graph’s name in the file or, depending on the format, assume that the file implicitly represents the default graph.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="case-2-multiple-graphs-per-file">Case 2: Multiple Graphs Per File<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#case-2-multiple-graphs-per-file"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>One file = Multiple graphs</strong>: If a file contains multiple named graphs, this is still aligned with the RDF dataset model. For example, a file could include several named graphs, and this file would represent a single RDF dataset with multiple components.</li>
<li><strong>Formats</strong>: In formats like TriG (or N-Quads), which support multiple graphs in one file, this approach is straightforward. The file would act as a container for all the graphs, meaning each file is effectively a dataset.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="case-3-dataset-as-a-conceptual-group">Case 3: Dataset as a Conceptual Group<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#case-3-dataset-as-a-conceptual-group"></a></h3>
<p>Even if a file contains just a fragment of data, you can treat it as part of a larger conceptual <strong>dataset</strong>. In this case, your repository structure might represent:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>collection of datasets</strong>: Multiple files that each represent a part of a larger dataset. Here, files might correspond to different graphs, and the dataset is formed by aggregating these files.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="considerations">Considerations:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#considerations"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Naming and Graph Identification</strong>: If each file represents a named graph, you might want a consistent naming convention that reflects the graph name or a metadata header to identify it.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Treating each file as a dataset makes it easier to manage or update specific segments of the RDF data independently. However, performance considerations may arise depending on the number of files and how the data is queried or accessed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kosmion-context">Kosmion Context<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#kosmion-context"></a></h3>
<p>In Kosmion, if you're using <strong>relators</strong> and possibly adopting <strong>named graphs</strong> for each relator, treating each file as a dataset containing one or more named graphs could fit well. This approach would allow you to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Isolate relator-based clusters</strong> in separate files.</li>
<li><strong>Version or update individual relators</strong> without needing to modify other parts of the ontology.</li>
</ol>
<p>This would work especially well if you're aiming for a decentralized and modular file-based structure where each file represents a specific facet of your ontology.</p>
<p>Does this align with how you're thinking of structuring RDF data in Kosmion?</p>
<h2 id="it-does">it does++<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#it-does"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>dave: So <dave-richardson> would represent an entity, every entity could reference at least one catalog which could "live" anywhere but &#x3C;dave-richardson/catalog> would be a good first choice, and be referenced from the catalog dataset, say &#x3C;dave-richardson/catalog/dist> which might have a Turtle distribution named &#x3C;dave-richardson/catalog/dist/ttl>. But the entity itself could (and should, if no data catalog is referenced) identify at least one dataset directly that is considered the "current" dataset. So &#x3C;dave-richardson/datasets/v1> could be the corresponding dataset. The different datasets would primarily be used for versioning or for spreading out data over multiple dataset files (in which case a data catalog should be used). I'm inclined against a dataset per relator. I'm not sure what role the named graphs would play any more if there's a dataset per version. Maybe metadata.</dave-richardson></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chatgpt:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like you've settled on a clean structure for organizing entities and datasets, where catalogs and datasets play distinct roles. I think your approach strikes a good balance between modularity (with catalogs) and versioning (with datasets like <code>&#x3C;dave-richardson/datasets/v1></code>). This allows flexibility in terms of data distribution while keeping a "current" dataset accessible when necessary.</p>
<h3 id="named-graphs-and-metadata">Named Graphs and Metadata<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#named-graphs-and-metadata"></a></h3>
<p>Since you're thinking about named graphs potentially being useful for metadata, that could work well for things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provenance information</strong>: Tracking where the data came from or who created it.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning info</strong>: Storing details about when and how a particular dataset was created or modified.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual data</strong>: If you need to add contextual information (e.g., temporal or spatial data) to a dataset, a named graph could isolate that metadata without cluttering the primary data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to avoid using named graphs for the data itself and instead focus on datasets per version, using them just for metadata makes sense, keeping the structure straightforward.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want to explore any of these aspects further!</p>
<h2 id="default-representations">Default Representations<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#default-representations"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>dave: I wouldn't say settled. But certainly a possibility. There's probably value in the idea of a "default representation" and "default catalog", where the person with access to the IRI-enclosing namespace has control of default and alternate representations , but can delegate total control (by pointing to someone else's data catalog AND default dataset) or partial control (delegating either one). A default catalog could specify its own default represenetation, so there could effectively be two defaults. But that's okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chatgpt: </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That makes sense, especially with the flexibility of delegating control over the catalog or dataset. Having a <strong>"default representation"</strong> and <strong>"default catalog"</strong> controlled by the namespace owner, while allowing delegation, gives you a powerful mechanism for managing data access and structure. It also opens up the possibility of collaborative or distributed data management without losing control over the core representations.</p>
<p>The potential for two defaults (one for the representation and one for the catalog) doesn’t seem problematic, especially if each serves a distinct purpose. The default catalog could handle the organization of data, while the default representation could specify how the data is accessed or interpreted.</p>
<p>If you're still exploring, this setup offers a lot of flexibility. Let me know if you want to dive deeper into specific delegation scenarios or ways to manage defaults!</p>
<h2 id="ontology-vs-semantic-data">ontology vs semantic data<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#ontology-vs-semantic-data"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>dave: can you provide references to papers, articles, blog posts, or social media where people argue that ontology does not imply "semantic data" in general or "knowledge graphs" in general? That the term "ontology" should be reserved for domain concepts, analagous to a schema?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chatgpt:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are multiple discussions and arguments that highlight the difference between ontologies and the broader concepts of "semantic data" or "knowledge graphs," where the term "ontology" is often more narrowly defined.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ontologies as Domain-Specific Models</strong>: Some experts argue that an ontology should primarily be viewed as a structured, domain-specific framework for organizing concepts, more analogous to a schema. This perspective suggests that ontologies provide a controlled vocabulary and relationships specific to a domain, whereas knowledge graphs often involve broader integration of data, including instance-level data, which isn't always tied to an explicit, domain-specific ontology. For example, ontologies like the <strong>Gene Ontology</strong> (GO) are specifically tailored to biological knowledge, focusing on well-defined relationships within that context, distinct from general knowledge graphs that handle diverse or cross-domain data【34†source】【35†source】.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ontologies vs. Knowledge Graphs</strong>: It is often emphasized that <strong>knowledge graphs</strong> are not synonymous with ontologies. Knowledge graphs may include data representations that don’t leverage full semantic inferencing or may involve vast amounts of instance data (like Google’s Knowledge Graph) without the formal semantics typical of an ontology. Some argue that the <strong>schema</strong> in a knowledge graph can exist without the rich conceptual relationships that define an ontology【33†source】【34†source】.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Schema vs. Ontology</strong>: Ontologies are often described as more flexible and expressive frameworks than rigid schemas, but there are arguments that ontologies should focus solely on domain modeling, similar to a schema, rather than broader tasks like data integration or reasoning across large datasets, which are common use cases for knowledge graphs. In this view, ontologies should serve as a "blueprint" for domain concepts, focusing on classes and relationships, rather than extending into instance data and semantic reasoning that knowledge graphs address【35†source】【36†source】.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, many argue that ontologies should remain more like a <strong>schema</strong>, focused on domain concepts, rather than being conflated with the broader tasks of <strong>semantic data</strong> or <strong>knowledge graphs</strong>, which may encompass much more than what ontologies are intended to model.</p>

Maybe context includes the other. But maybe we need a term other than metadata, because it's really more just data. e.g. :Bart  a :Person in context:Simpsons-World<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#so-i-want-to-be-able-to-apply-metadata-like-context-the-reality-where-the-statements-are-asserted-true-system-time-the-period-for-which-they-were-asserted-and-attribution-who-asserted-to-be-applicable-on-two-levels-the-individual-relator-and-the-datasets-ie-all-relators-in-the-dataset-maybe-context-includes-the-other-but-maybe-we-need-a-term-other-than-metadata-because-its-really-more-just-data-eg-bart--a-person-in-contextsimpsons-world"></a></h2>
<p>Your idea of applying context, system-time, and attribution as <strong>data</strong> rather than metadata makes sense, especially given that these elements are intrinsic to the assertions themselves. The distinction you're making is crucial: these aren't just metadata annotations but are part of the core reality being modeled.</p>
<p>To apply this at <strong>two levels</strong>—for both the <strong>relator</strong> and the <strong>dataset</strong>—you can think of:</p>

<li><strong>Context</strong>: The world or reality where this relation holds true. For example, <code>context:Simpsons-World</code> applies directly to a relation like <code>:Bart a :Person</code>.</li>
<li><strong>System-Time</strong>: The period during which the relation is valid, possibly encoded as the system-level start and end times.</li>
<li><strong>Attribution</strong>: Who asserted or originated the relation, possibly using a relator-creator property.</li>

<h3 id="2-dataset-level-context">2. <strong>Dataset-Level Context</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-dataset-level-context"></a></h3>
<p>For dataset-level context, which would apply to all relators in a dataset, you might specify a broader context that encompasses all the relations in the dataset. This would be useful for large-scale assertions, like stating that all relations in a file apply to a certain reality, were asserted within a certain time frame, or were all attributed to the same source.</p>
<p>If you treat context as hierarchical or containing other elements, this could mean that the dataset-level context applies as a broader frame, and the relator-specific context could add nuance or specialize it.</p>
<p>Example (dataset-level):</p>

<p>All relators in <code>Dataset1</code> would inherit <code>context:Simpsons-Universe</code>, unless overridden by individual relators. This allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply broad contexts or attribution to all relations.</li>
<li>Specialize individual relations with more granular context or time-based assertions if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="naming-considerations">Naming Considerations<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#naming-considerations"></a></h3>
<p>You mentioned looking for another term besides "metadata." Since you're thinking of these as part of the <strong>core data</strong>, you could use terms like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contextual Data</strong>: Emphasizing that this is part of the relation itself, not external metadata.</li>
<li><strong>Assertion Context</strong>: This could indicate the reality or system-time in which the assertion is true.</li>
<li><strong>Relational Scope</strong>: To emphasize that context applies to the scope in which relations are true or valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>This dual-level structure could work well with your relator-based approach, especially when combined with versioning and system-time management. Let me know if you'd like further refinement on specific areas!</p>

<p>Adding a <strong>third level</strong> for the <strong>named graph</strong> is a logical extension that helps organize and scope the applicability of context, system-time, and attribution more precisely. Here's how this might break down:</p>
<h3 id="1-relator-level-context-1">1. <strong>Relator-Level Context</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-relator-level-context-1"></a></h3>
<p>At the most granular level, each individual relator can carry its own context, system-time, and attribution data. This would allow fine-tuned control over the assertions made by that specific relation.</p>

<p>At the highest level, a dataset containing multiple named graphs could also include shared context, system-time, and attribution that apply to all the named graphs and their relations.

<li><strong>Dataset Level</strong>: High-level metadata that applies across multiple named graphs, providing context for versioning or large-scale assertions.</li>

<p>You're absolutely right that the distinction between "data about the thing" and "data about the data" can get confusing, particularly when modeling metadata in RDF or related structures.</p>
<p>One way to resolve this is by clearly separating <strong>contextualized data (about the thing)</strong> from <strong>metadata (about the data itself)</strong>. Your suggestion to use the <strong>default graph</strong> for metadata and <strong>contextualized graphs</strong> (e.g., named graphs) for the actual data makes a lot of sense.</p>
<h3 id="conceptual-framework">Conceptual Framework:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conceptual-framework"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Default Graph for Metadata</strong>:
The <strong>default graph</strong> can contain system-level information, versioning, provenance, or any other data describing the structure or source of the dataset. Essentially, this would be the "data about the data" that applies to the entire dataset or specific named graphs.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Named Graphs for Contextualized Data</strong>:
<strong>Named graphs</strong> would then represent specific chunks of data that are contextualized within a particular reality, time period, or attribution. These named graphs are where the actual domain data (i.e., data about the thing) resides.</p>

<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default Graph (Metadata)</strong>: Contains all system-level information like who asserted the dataset, when it was generated, version control, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Named Graphs (Contextualized Data)</strong>: Contains data that is tied to specific domains, contexts, or realities, giving flexibility for handling different "worlds" or interpretations of the data.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Clear separation</strong> between <strong>"data about the thing"</strong> (which is in the named/contextual graphs) and <strong>"data about the data"</strong> (which is in the default graph).</li>
<li>This approach allows <strong>flexibility</strong> for managing multiple contexts or realities while ensuring that system-level metadata is isolated and easy to manage.</li>

<p>Yes, if you're storing a <strong>complete snapshot</strong> in each new graph or dataset, you effectively eliminate the need for deltas (which track only the changes between versions). Instead, you can still maintain a notion of <strong>delta source and reason</strong> for tracking why certain changes were made, without the complexity of reconstructing deltas for every change.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Complete Snapshots</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each version of your data is stored as a full snapshot in either a new <strong>named graph</strong> or a new <strong>dataset</strong>. This means that you have a full, self-contained version of the dataset at every point in time, which simplifies retrieval and avoids the complexity of managing deltas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delta Source &#x26; Reason</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of storing explicit deltas, you could track the <strong>source</strong> of changes (who or what initiated the modification) and the <strong>reason</strong> (e.g., typo fix, data update, correction) at different levels: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Per-relator</strong>: Each relator could carry metadata about its source and why it was updated or created.</li>
<li><strong>Per-graph</strong>: A named graph could carry metadata about the changes it contains and why the snapshot was made.</li>
<li><strong>Per-dataset</strong>: The dataset as a whole could track a high-level reason for its creation, versioning, and updates.</li>
</ul>

<p>This model allows you to retain <strong>complete version histories</strong> while still explaining why changes were made, at whatever level of granularity you need.</p>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#advantages"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplifies management</strong>: No need to compute or manage deltas between versions.</li>
<li><strong>Easy retrieval</strong>: Any version can be retrieved as a full snapshot without needing to reconstruct it from earlier versions.</li>
<li><strong>Context for changes</strong>: You still maintain the ability to explain why changes happened and who made them without adding complexity to the data structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#use-cases"></a></h3>
<p>This approach works well when:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> is not a constraint, as you’re storing full snapshots.</li>
<li><strong>Data auditability</strong> is important, and you want to track changes explicitly at various levels.</li>

<h2 id="in-my-kosmion-ontology-where-i-want-to-embrace-multi-level-theory-where-things-are-individuals-and-classes-can-you-think-of-any-places-owlnamedindividual-could-be-useful">In my Kosmion ontology, where I want to embrace multi-level theory where things are individuals and classes. Can you think of any places "owl:NamedIndividual" could be useful.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#in-my-kosmion-ontology-where-i-want-to-embrace-multi-level-theory-where-things-are-individuals-and-classes-can-you-think-of-any-places-owlnamedindividual-could-be-useful"></a></h2>
<p>In your Kosmion ontology, which aims to embrace <strong>multi-level theory</strong> where things are both <strong>individuals and classes</strong>, <strong>owl:NamedIndividual</strong> could be quite useful in several ways. Here are some key areas where it could be applied:</p>
<h3 id="1-multi-level-entities">1. <strong>Multi-Level Entities</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-multi-level-entities"></a></h3>
<p>In a multi-level ontology, entities can exist at different levels (e.g., a template or a prototype that is both an instance and a class). <strong>owl:NamedIndividual</strong> allows you to represent an entity that is both a concrete individual and a class that can have instances. For example, an individual reality like <code>:RealityPrime</code> could be both:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>instance</strong> of the class <code>:Reality</code> at one level, and</li>
<li>A <strong>class</strong> for other, more specific realities (e.g., <code>:SimpsonsWorld</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>This dual representation fits with <strong>multi-level modeling</strong>, where levels of abstraction coexist, and something can be a concrete individual while also serving as a type.</p>
<h3 id="2-relators-as-individuals-and-classes">2. <strong>Relators as Individuals and Classes</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-relators-as-individuals-and-classes"></a></h3>
<p>Your relator-based approach could also benefit from <strong>owl:NamedIndividual</strong> when a relator serves both as a specific instance of a relationship (linking specific entities) and as a general class of relationships. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>A specific relationship like <code>:BartKnowsHomerRelator</code> could be a <strong>NamedIndividual</strong> while also being a <strong>class</strong> that other similar relationships instantiate (e.g., <code>:LisaKnowsMargeRelator</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-etdf-datatypes-as-individuals-and-classes">3. <strong>ETDF Datatypes as Individuals and Classes</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#3-etdf-datatypes-as-individuals-and-classes"></a></h3>
<p>Since you've mentioned EDTF datatypes are both classes and individuals, <strong>owl:NamedIndividual</strong> can allow you to treat a particular date format as both:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>class</strong> representing a general type of date, such as <code>EDTF_Year</code>.</li>
<li>An <strong>individual</strong>, such as <code>EDTF_Year2024</code>, which is a concrete instance of that type.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-contexts-or-worlds">4. <strong>Contexts or Worlds</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#4-contexts-or-worlds"></a></h3>
<p>If you're modeling different <strong>contexts or worlds</strong> (e.g., <code>:SimpsonsWorld</code>, <code>:RealityPrime</code>), these can be treated as <strong>NamedIndividuals</strong> that are both:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concrete instances</strong> of broader categories of realities or contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong> that further specialize into more specific contexts (e.g., <code>:SimpsonsSeason1</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-facets-as-both-instances-and-classes">5. <strong>Facets as Both Instances and Classes</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#5-facets-as-both-instances-and-classes"></a></h3>
<p>If you're implementing <strong>facets</strong> (singular properties) as a fundamental unit, a facet can be both an individual and a class. For instance, a facet like <code>:Gender</code> can be an individual, but you might also want it to act as a class for more specific instantiations such as <code>:Male</code> or <code>:Female</code>.</p>
<p>By using <strong>owl:NamedIndividual</strong>, you can manage this fluid boundary between <strong>types and instances</strong>, allowing entities to operate as both, depending on the context or level in the ontology.</p>

<p>Using consecutive numbering like "1", "2", instead of prefixes like "v1", "v2" for versioning has pros and cons depending on your goals:</p>
<h3 id="pros-of-consecutive-numbering">Pros of Consecutive Numbering:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pros-of-consecutive-numbering"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simplifies Parsing</strong>: Without the "v", parsing is easier, especially in automated processes where distinguishing the version number from the rest of the IRI might be unnecessary. It reduces the need to strip characters or check for prefixes.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Cleanliness</strong>: Eliminates the extra character, making IRIs cleaner, especially when working with long or deeply nested IRI structures.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cons-of-removing-v">Cons of Removing "v":<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cons-of-removing-v"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Potential Ambiguity</strong>: The absence of the "v" could lead to confusion if the numbering scheme isn’t immediately clear to users or systems. For example, without the "v", it may not be obvious that "1" or "2" represents a version number.</li>
<li><strong>Context Clarity</strong>: Using "v" explicitly denotes that the number refers to a version, making it clear that you're referring to different snapshots or states of the same entity or dataset, which helps especially in collaborative or public settings where multiple versioning schemes may coexist.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="trade-off">Trade-off:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#trade-off"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consecutive numbering</strong> is more concise and simplifies processing but may sacrifice some of the clarity provided by explicitly marking versions.</li>
<li><strong>Including "v"</strong> helps ensure that it's immediately clear the number is a version, but it introduces a slight increase in complexity for parsing and visual scanning.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your environment prioritizes clarity and collaboration across teams or users unfamiliar with the specifics of the system, keeping the "v" might be preferable. If you're working in a more controlled, internal system where reducing complexity and maximizing efficiency is key, skipping the "v" could be an advantage.</p>
<p>You could also consider making the decision based on the <strong>context</strong> where the versions will be used.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-distinguish-between-a-dataset-and-thing-described-by-a-dataset">How can I distinguish between a dataset and thing described by a dataset.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-can-i-distinguish-between-a-dataset-and-thing-described-by-a-dataset"></a></h2>
<p>To distinguish between a <strong>dataset</strong> and a <strong>thing described by a dataset</strong> within an RDF or OWL context, you can follow these guidelines:</p>
<h3 id="1-dataset-as-metadata-carrier">1. <strong>Dataset as Metadata Carrier</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-dataset-as-metadata-carrier"></a></h3>
<p>A <strong>dataset</strong> typically represents a collection of statements, which can be about many things (entities, relationships, etc.). The dataset itself can have <strong>metadata</strong> that describes the <strong>provenance</strong>, <strong>versioning</strong>, or <strong>context</strong> of the dataset, separate from the entities it describes. You can represent a dataset as a <strong>container</strong> or <strong>collection</strong> of RDF triples, using something like <strong>VoID (Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets)</strong> or <strong>DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary)</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the dataset can be described like this:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Dataset1</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">dcat<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Dataset</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>

    <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">dct<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">created</span></span> <span class="token string">"2024-10-21"</span><span class="token punctuation">^^</span><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">xsd<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">date</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>

    <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">dcat<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">distribution</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">SimpsonsDatasetDistribution</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This metadata describes the dataset as a whole, not the entities described within the dataset.</p>
<h3 id="2-thing-described-by-a-dataset">2. <strong>Thing Described by a Dataset</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-thing-described-by-a-dataset"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>things</strong> described by the dataset are the actual entities (e.g., people, objects, concepts) that the RDF triples within the dataset describe. These are the <strong>subject</strong> or <strong>objects</strong> in the RDF data, like a person, organization, event, etc.</p>
<p>For example, a thing described by the dataset could be <code>:BartSimpson</code>, an individual entity that exists <strong>inside</strong> the dataset:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">BartSimpson</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Person</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">name</span></span> <span class="token string">"Bart Simpson"</span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">livesIn</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Springfield</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="3-using-named-graphs-for-context-separation">3. <strong>Using Named Graphs for Context Separation</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#3-using-named-graphs-for-context-separation"></a></h3>
<p>You can use <strong>named graphs</strong> to separate <strong>dataset-level</strong> metadata from <strong>entity descriptions</strong>. The named graph contains the <strong>descriptions of entities</strong>, while the dataset itself (which might be the whole graph or collection of graphs) is associated with its own metadata.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token keyword">GRAPH</span> <span class="token url"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>http://example.com/graph/simpsons<span class="token punctuation">></span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">BartSimpson</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Person</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
        <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">livesIn</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Springfield</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And then the dataset itself can have metadata:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">SimpsonsDataset</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">dcat<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Dataset</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">dcat<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">theme</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">FictionalCharacters</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">dcat<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">distribution</span></span> <span class="token url"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>http://example.com/graph/simpsons<span class="token punctuation">></span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="4-ontology-based-differentiation">4. <strong>Ontology-Based Differentiation</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#4-ontology-based-differentiation"></a></h3>
<p>If you're working within OWL or another ontology, you can further differentiate the <strong>dataset</strong> from the <strong>things it describes</strong> by classifying them differently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dataset</strong>: Use classes like <code>dcat:Dataset</code>, <code>void:Dataset</code>, or <code>prov:Entity</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Things Described</strong>: Use relevant <strong>domain-specific classes</strong>, such as <code>:Person</code>, <code>:Location</code>, <code>:Event</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures clarity when defining the type of each resource.</p>
<p>In summary, you distinguish between a dataset and the things it describes by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dataset</strong>: Described using <strong>metadata vocabularies</strong> like DCAT, VoID, or PROV, representing the container or structure of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Things</strong>: Represented as <strong>domain-specific classes</strong> that describe actual entities within the dataset. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iri-conceptual-collisions">IRI conceptual collisions<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#iri-conceptual-collisions"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>dave:</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me give you more background on my issue. Say there was an IRI "<a href="https://example.org/BartSimpson%22">https://example.org/BartSimpson"</a> that I want to refer to an individual, (e.g., an owl:Thing). Conventionally, if you retrieved some RDF from that URL, it would return a dataset about Bart Simpson. But then the IRI also refers to a dataset. even if the RDF returned is only a simple statement, e.g. ":BartSimpson a :Person", that's still a dataset. Even if it's only metadata, e.g. ':BartSimpson rdfs:comment "a page about Bart"', it still a dataset. Even if it's a dcat Catalog pointing to places where data and metadata exist, or a pointer to a dcat catalog, that's all a dataset.</p>
<ul>
<li>chatgpt:</li>
</ul>
<p>You've described a common issue in RDF and linked data, where the <strong>same IRI</strong> is being used to refer both to an <strong>individual</strong> (such as a person, e.g., Bart Simpson) and to a <strong>dataset</strong> that describes that individual. This results in a conceptual collision between referring to an <strong>entity</strong> and referring to <strong>data about the entity</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#key-concepts"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individual (Entity)</strong>: In this case, <code>:BartSimpson</code> is an <strong>owl:Thing</strong> (or possibly an <code>owl:NamedIndividual</code>), a real or fictional entity being described.</li>
<li><strong>Dataset</strong>: The RDF returned from <code>https://example.org/BartSimpson</code> is a dataset, even if it contains only a single RDF statement like <code>:BartSimpson a :Person</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="challenge">Challenge:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#challenge"></a></h3>
<p>The issue is that by convention, the IRI both points to <strong>data about</strong> Bart Simpson (a dataset) and to <strong>Bart Simpson himself</strong> (an individual entity). Even a simple RDF statement such as <code>:BartSimpson a :Person</code> can be considered a <strong>dataset</strong>. As a result, the IRI is overloaded with dual meaning, potentially causing confusion.</p>
<h3 id="solutions">Solutions:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#solutions"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Separation of Concerns: Different IRIs for Entity and Dataset</strong>:
A simple approach is to use <strong>different IRIs</strong> for the <strong>individual</strong> and the <strong>dataset</strong> that describes the individual.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>Use <code>https://example.org/BartSimpson</code> to refer to <strong>Bart Simpson</strong> the individual.</li>
<li>Use <code>https://example.org/datasets/BartSimpson</code> to refer to a <strong>dataset</strong> about Bart Simpson.
This way, the distinction is clear: one IRI points to the actual entity, while the other points to the dataset that describes the entity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use of Fragment Identifiers</strong>:
Another approach is to use <strong>fragment identifiers</strong> (<code>#</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://example.org/BartSimpson</code> refers to the <strong>individual</strong> Bart Simpson.</li>
<li><code>https://example.org/BartSimpson#data</code> refers to the <strong>dataset</strong> about Bart Simpson.
Fragment identifiers are often used to distinguish between resources while keeping the base IRI the same, allowing a clean distinction between an entity and data about the entity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conventional Use of Linked Data Resources</strong>:
You could follow the linked data pattern where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://example.org/BartSimpson</code> is understood to be the <strong>individual</strong> (the actual person or entity), and the RDF data returned provides descriptions <strong>about</strong> Bart Simpson (metadata).
In this case, the dataset is implicit, and it's common practice for the IRI to resolve to a dataset that describes the entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this pattern leaves it ambiguous whether the IRI refers to the <strong>entity</strong> or the <strong>dataset</strong>. To resolve this ambiguity, you might:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Include explicit metadata using vocabularies like <strong>DCAT</strong> or <strong>PROV</strong> to indicate that the dataset refers to a description <strong>about</strong> the individual, not the individual itself:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">BartSimpson</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Person</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
   <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">rdfs<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">comment</span></span> <span class="token string">"This is Bart Simpson, a fictional character from The Simpsons."</span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>

</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contextualizing Data with Named Graphs</strong>:
If the dataset contains more detailed information and metadata, you can use <strong>named graphs</strong> to differentiate between the <strong>data about the entity</strong> and the <strong>entity itself</strong>. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Different IRIs</strong> for the entity and dataset are the most straightforward solution, ensuring clarity for both human users and machines.</li>
<li><strong>Fragment identifiers</strong> offer a way to distinguish between different aspects (the individual vs. the dataset) while maintaining the base IRI.</li>
<li>If you prefer to keep a single IRI, you could lean on linked data conventions but include explicit metadata to clarify whether you're referring to the entity or the dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach should help clarify the distinction between an <strong>individual</strong> and the <strong>dataset</strong> describing it in Kosmion or similar systems.</p>
<h2 id="html-is-the-answer-anyhow">HTML is the answer anyhow<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#html-is-the-answer-anyhow"></a></h2>

<li>dave:</li>
</ul>
<p>If I use different IRIs, how to I make the datasets and data catalogs discoverable from the initial IRI? Maybe just a web page? We've talked about metadata in the , and you could also standardize on machine-readable body html. It's almost a shame that RDF apps would need to parse HTML, but on the other hand, using github for hosting those entity IRIs, it's gotta return HTML anyhow since there's no content negotiation.</p>
<ul>
<li>chatgpt:</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that you're using different IRIs for entities and datasets, and you're hosting them on platforms like GitHub where content negotiation isn't available, a <strong>hybrid approach</strong> combining <strong>HTML web pages</strong> with embedded <strong>machine-readable metadata</strong> could work well. Here’s a practical strategy for discoverability:</p>
<h3 id="1-html-as-the-primary-content">1. <strong>HTML as the Primary Content</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-html-as-the-primary-content"></a></h3>
<p>The entity IRI (e.g., <code>https://example.org/BartSimpson</code>) can resolve to a simple <strong>web page</strong> that provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human-readable information</strong> about the entity (Bart Simpson).</li>
<li><strong>Embedded metadata</strong> in the <code>&#x3C;head></code> using JSON-LD, RDFa, or similar, ensuring that RDF-aware applications can still extract semantic data without parsing the HTML body extensively.</li>
</ul>

<p>This setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human-friendly</strong>: Displays entity information for typical web users.</li>
<li><strong>Machine-readable</strong>: Embeds RDF via JSON-LD or RDFa in the <code>&#x3C;head></code> so RDF apps can process the structured data.</li>
<li><strong>Linked datasets</strong>: Provides a clear link to the dataset IRI (<code>https://example.org/datasets/BartSimpson</code>) in both the <strong>body</strong> for humans and the <strong>metadata</strong> for machines.</li>

<p>Embedding machine-readable data in the <code>&#x3C;head></code> section allows RDF-aware applications to extract information without needing to parse HTML. For example, you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JSON-LD</strong> (for its simplicity and wide adoption).</li>
<li><strong>RDFa</strong> (for directly embedding RDF within the HTML).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-machine-readable-html-body">3. <strong>Machine-Readable HTML Body</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#3-machine-readable-html-body"></a></h3>
<p>Though parsing HTML body content isn’t ideal for RDF apps, you can <strong>standardize your HTML output</strong> with structured elements (like <code>microdata</code> or well-defined classes) that make it easier for parsers to extract data if necessary. For example:</p>

<p>Since GitHub primarily serves static HTML:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML-first</strong>: Ensures that even users who land on the entity IRI will get a useful, human-readable page.</li>
<li><strong>Embedded metadata</strong>: Keeps RDF-aware apps functional without requiring sophisticated content negotiation mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: This method scales well, as each entity IRI can follow the same structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion"></a></h3>
<p>By delivering <strong>HTML pages</strong> enriched with <strong>embedded RDF metadata</strong>, you ensure both <strong>human usability</strong> and <strong>machine readability</strong>, even when content negotiation isn’t available. This strategy fits well with GitHub Pages and other static hosting platforms, offering flexibility for both web and RDF-based applications.</p>

<p>I think this approach will work. Let's switch the example from Bart to me. So my IRI is <a href="https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson">https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson</a> - it returns HTML pointing to my dataset and catalog distributions, which maybe should have IRIs themselves, but more imporantly, have distribution URLs. &#x3C;dave-richardson/default/current/dist/> is a "pointer IRI" that refers to my "default" dataset distributions, which should all represent the same data in different formats, and which are individually pointers, e.g. &#x3C;dave-richardson/default/current/dist/ttl> to a versioned dataset IRI, e.g. &#x3C;dave-richardson/default/v1/dist/ttl>. By convention, the default dataset for a Thing should contain references to any data catalogs (which are also datasets), so follow the same convention, e.g. &#x3C;dave-richardson/default-catalog/v1/dist/ttl></p>
<ul>

<p>Your approach using <strong>pointer IRIs</strong> to manage dataset and catalog distributions looks solid and provides a clear structure. Let’s break it down using your example for <strong><a href="https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson">https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson</a></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="structure-for-dataset-and-catalog-distributions">Structure for Dataset and Catalog Distributions<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#structure-for-dataset-and-catalog-distributions"></a></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson">https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson</a></strong>: This URL will point to an HTML page that contains information about you, Dave Richardson, and provides links to both the dataset and data catalogs. The HTML page will serve both human-readable content and machine-readable metadata using RDFa or JSON-LD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pointer IRI for Default Dataset Distributions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#x3C;dave-richardson/default/current/dist/></strong>: This "pointer IRI" refers to the <strong>default dataset</strong> distributions (current version) in various formats. Each of these distributions represents the <strong>same data</strong> in different formats like Turtle, JSON-LD, etc.</li>
<li>Example of formats:
<ul>
<li><strong>&#x3C;dave-richardson/default/current/dist/ttl></strong>: Points to the <strong>Turtle version</strong> of the default dataset.</li>
<li><strong>&#x3C;dave-richardson/default/current/dist/jsonld></strong>: Points to the <strong>JSON-LD version</strong> of the default dataset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Versioned Dataset IRIs</strong>:
Each pointer to a format, like <code>&#x3C;dave-richardson/default/current/dist/ttl></code>, should in turn point to the <strong>specific versioned dataset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#x3C;dave-richardson/default/v1/dist/ttl></strong>: A specific versioned Turtle dataset.</li>
<li>You can increment these versions as needed (e.g., <code>v2</code>, <code>v3</code>, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pointer IRI for Data Catalog</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#x3C;dave-richardson/default-catalog/current/dist/></strong>: This IRI refers to the current distribution of your <strong>default catalog</strong>. Like datasets, the catalog can exist in multiple formats:
<ul>
<li><strong>&#x3C;dave-richardson/default-catalog/current/dist/ttl></strong>: Points to the <strong>Turtle version</strong> of the catalog.</li>
<li><strong>&#x3C;dave-richardson/default-catalog/v1/dist/ttl></strong>: Points to a specific version of the catalog.</li>

<li><strong>Entity IRI</strong>: <code>https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson</code> returns HTML with links to datasets and catalogs.</li>
<li><strong>Pointer IRIs</strong>: <code>default/current/dist/</code> points to the latest version of the dataset in various formats.</li>
<li><strong>Versioned IRIs</strong>: Versioned datasets (e.g., <code>default/v1/dist/ttl</code>) maintain a history of changes.</li>
<li><strong>Metadata in <code>&#x3C;head></code></strong>: Use JSON-LD to include machine-readable metadata in the HTML header for RDF apps.</li>

<p>Your idea of dispensing with the <strong>default-catalog</strong> and making a set of files like <code>index.ttl</code>, <code>index.jsonld</code>, etc., available at the root for discoverability through RDF is a practical solution. Here's how you could implement it:</p>

<p>Providing <strong>index files</strong> (<code>index.ttl</code>, <code>index.jsonld</code>, etc.) at the root of your IRI namespace allows RDF-aware systems to start from a known entry point. These files can provide pointers to datasets, distributions, and other relevant resources.</p>
<p>Example of <code>index.ttl</code>:</p>

<p>This <strong>index file</strong> provides the first entry point for RDF applications, listing the available datasets and distributions in Turtle and JSON-LD formats.</p>
<h3 id="2-file-naming-conventions">2. <strong>File Naming Conventions</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-file-naming-conventions"></a></h3>
<p>By adopting clear file naming conventions, you make it easy to navigate between different versions and formats. Here’s a breakdown of how files could be structured:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index.ttl</code>, <code>index.jsonld</code>: For the initial discovery of resources.</li>
<li><code>default/current/dist/ttl</code>, <code>default/current/dist/jsonld</code>: Points to the latest version of the dataset.</li>
<li><code>default/v1/dist/ttl</code>, <code>default/v1/dist/jsonld</code>: Specific versioned datasets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-self-descriptive-rdf-files">3. <strong>Self-Descriptive RDF Files</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#3-self-descriptive-rdf-files"></a></h3>
<p>Each file (<code>index.ttl</code>, <code>index.jsonld</code>, etc.) can include self-descriptive metadata that points to its purpose and other related resources. This way, both RDF and non-RDF-aware systems can start from the <strong>root IRI</strong> and navigate to all necessary datasets, catalogs, and distributions.</p>
<h3 id="4-discoverability">4. <strong>Discoverability</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#4-discoverability"></a></h3>
<p>This approach ensures that everything is <strong>discoverable purely through RDF</strong> by using standard vocabularies like <strong>DCAT</strong> and <strong>Dublin Core Terms (DCT)</strong>. RDF clients can start with any of the <strong>index files</strong> and follow the links to the appropriate datasets.</p>
<p>Example of how this works:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client retrieves <code>https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/index.ttl</code>.</li>
<li>From there, it discovers links to the Turtle, JSON-LD, and other versions of the dataset (<code>default/current/dist/ttl</code>, etc.).</li>
<li>The client can follow the links to retrieve the actual data in the desired format.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-serving-the-human-readable-html">5. <strong>Serving the Human-Readable HTML</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#5-serving-the-human-readable-html"></a></h3>
<p>You can still serve a <strong>human-readable HTML page</strong> at the root IRI (<code>https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson</code>), but the RDF files (<code>index.ttl</code>, <code>index.jsonld</code>) will ensure that everything is also <strong>machine-readable</strong>.</p>
<p>This approach ensures both RDF and human users can access and navigate your datasets easily. Does this seem like a solid direction for your project?</p>
<h2 id="maybe-we-dont-need-a-dist-iri-separate-from-the-download-iri-eg-httpsdjradongithubiodave-richardsondsdefaultv1indexttl">maybe we don't need a dist IRI separate from the download IRI, e.g. <a href="https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/ds/default/v1/index.ttl">https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/ds/default/v1/index.ttl</a><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#maybe-we-dont-need-a-dist-iri-separate-from-the-download-iri-eg-httpsdjradongithubiodave-richardsondsdefaultv1indexttl"></a></h2>
<p>By using a direct download IRI like <code>https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/ds/default/v1/index.ttl</code> without a separate distribution IRI, you can simplify the structure and make it easier to access the actual dataset files. This approach eliminates the need for an additional "distribution IRI" that points to the data, which streamlines the navigation for both human users and machines.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-this-approach">Benefits of This Approach:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#benefits-of-this-approach"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Reducing the number of layers between the IRI and the actual data makes it easier to navigate. Users and machines can directly fetch the dataset files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong>: By using a single IRI for both metadata and actual data, you maintain a consistent structure across your resources, reducing the complexity of managing multiple IRIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Better Alignment with RDF Discoverability</strong>: If RDF clients and applications can directly access the actual files (e.g., <code>index.ttl</code>, <code>index.jsonld</code>), they don’t need to follow multiple links to get to the download point.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="updated-structure">Updated Structure:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#updated-structure"></a></h3>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pointer IRI</strong>: <code>&#x3C;dave-richardson/default/current/dist/ttl></code></li>
<li><strong>Download IRI</strong>: <code>&#x3C;dave-richardson/default/v1/dist/ttl></code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can just use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct download IRI</strong>: <code>https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/ds/default/v1/index.ttl</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This streamlined approach ensures that the dataset files are immediately accessible while still maintaining the flexibility to reference different formats and versions.</p>
<p>If you plan to reference different versions and formats, the URL structure can still maintain clear distinctions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turtle</strong>: <code>https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/ds/default/v1/index.ttl</code></li>
<li><strong>JSON-LD</strong>: <code>https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/ds/default/v1/index.jsonld</code></li>
</ul>
<p>By embedding this structure within your metadata or <code>index.ttl</code>, you ensure that everything remains discoverable and accessible.</p>
<p>This seems like a smooth way forward. Does it fit your plans?</p>

<p>Thanks for clarifying! So your <strong>pointer IRI</strong> (e.g., <code>&#x3C;https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/ds/default/></code>) serves as an alias or reference for the <strong>current</strong> version of a dataset, possibly allowing for version aliasing or dynamic redirection to the latest dataset. </p>
<h3 id="usage-breakdown-1">Usage Breakdown:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#usage-breakdown-1"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Pointer IRI</strong>:  </p>
<ul>
<li><code>&#x3C;https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/ds/default/></code>: This pointer IRI represents the <strong>current version</strong> of the dataset, which might alias or redirect to the latest dataset version. This simplifies access to the most up-to-date data without needing to reference specific versions every time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Versioned Dataset IRI</strong>:  </p>
<ul>
<li><code>&#x3C;https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/ds/default/v1/></code>: This IRI refers to a <strong>specific version</strong> of the dataset (version 1 in this case), which is distinct from the pointer IRI. It provides access to a stable versioned dataset, ensuring that specific versions can be referenced as needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File-level IRIs for Distributions</strong>:<br>
Each distribution format (e.g., Turtle, JSON-LD) would be linked under the versioned dataset, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&#x3C;https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/ds/default/v1/index.ttl></code>: Turtle format.</li>
<li><code>&#x3C;https://djradon.github.io/dave-richardson/ds/default/v1/index.jsonld></code>: JSON-LD format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="benefits-1">Benefits:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#benefits-1"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pointer IRIs</strong> simplify linking to the most recent data, especially in applications or systems that need to always point to the "current" version.</li>
<li><strong>Versioned dataset IRIs</strong> ensure that older versions can still be accessed for consistency or archival purposes.</li>
<li><strong>File-level IRIs</strong> offer the flexibility of accessing the data in different formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach keeps the flexibility you need for versioning while maintaining simplicity for users and systems looking for the current version of your dataset.</p>

<p>In GitHub Pages, there can be <strong>name conflicts</strong> between a repository-based site (like <code>djradon.github.io/wiki</code>) and the user or organization site (<code>djradon.github.io</code>) because GitHub Pages serves different types of sites depending on the repository structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>User/Organization Site</strong> (<code>djradon.github.io</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>This site corresponds to the repository named <code>djradon.github.io</code>. It is served at the root of the domain (e.g., <code>https://djradon.github.io/</code>), and its content typically comes from either the <code>main</code> or <code>master</code> branch, or a specific branch (e.g., <code>gh-pages</code>).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Priority</strong>: GitHub will prioritize <strong>project sites</strong> over any similarly named folders in your user/organization site.

<p>Using a <strong>relator</strong> to bring together the <strong>class</strong>, <strong>individual</strong>, <strong>property</strong>, and <strong>annotation</strong> for an entity that occupies multiple roles (e.g., a class and an individual) could indeed help preserve compatibility with <strong>OWL 2 DL</strong> while supporting <strong>multi-level modeling</strong>. Here's how this might work:</p>
<h3 id="1-relators-as-mediators">1. <strong>Relators as Mediators</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-relators-as-mediators"></a></h3>
<p>By using a <strong>relator</strong> as the central entity, you can create a structure that ties together the different aspects of an entity, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class</strong>: Treats the entity as a type.</li>
<li><strong>Individual</strong>: Treats the entity as a specific instance.</li>
<li><strong>Property</strong>: Refers to the relationship the entity has with other things.</li>
<li><strong>Annotation</strong>: Allows you to attach metadata or other annotations to the entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure prevents the <strong>direct mixing</strong> of OWL class and individual declarations that could otherwise violate OWL 2 DL constraints.</p>
<h3 id="2-example-with-multi-alias">2. <strong>Example with Multi-Alias</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-example-with-multi-alias"></a></h3>
<p>Each alias can reference different facets of the entity (e.g., one alias for the class role, another for the individual role). The <strong>relator</strong> can mediate these aspects and still allow inference or querying based on whether the thing is being treated as a class or an individual in a given context.</p>
<p>Example structure:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Relator1</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">MultiLevelRelator</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<h3 id="3-preserving-owl-2-dl">3. <strong>Preserving OWL 2 DL</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#3-preserving-owl-2-dl"></a></h3>
<p>OWL 2 DL disallows mixing an entity's role as both a class and an individual, which is where this relator-based design helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>By having the relator <strong>bridge</strong> these roles, you can keep the <strong>class aspect</strong> and <strong>individual aspect</strong> separate within OWL 2 DL but still maintain the <strong>multi-level distinction</strong>.</li>
<li>This approach would avoid OWL 2 DL's constraints about not treating the same IRI as both a class and an individual.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-multi-alias">4. <strong>Multi-Alias</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#4-multi-alias"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>multi-alias</strong> approach helps ensure that the entity is flexible in terms of how it is referenced in different contexts, enabling it to be treated as an individual, class, or annotation as needed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alias for Class</strong>: Allows the entity to function as a type in one context.</li>
<li><strong>Alias for Individual</strong>: Permits the entity to act as a specific instance in another.</li>
<li><strong>Alias for Property</strong>: Used to represent the entity in a relational context.</li>
<li><strong>Alias for Annotation</strong>: Facilitates the addition of metadata or descriptive notes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>OWL 2 DL Compliance</strong>: By keeping the roles separated through the relator, you avoid violating OWL 2 DL's constraints, ensuring reasoners can still process the ontology.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Level Flexibility</strong>: You can manage entities that serve multiple roles without needing to compromise on their representation, achieving the desired multi-level modeling.</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems like a promising way to balance <strong>multi-level theory</strong> with the strict <strong>OWL 2 DL</strong> rules. Would you like to refine this further or explore more detailed examples?</p>

<p>The <strong>DCAT vocabulary (Data Catalog Vocabulary)</strong> is the specification that explicitly defines the concept of a <strong>distribution</strong>. In DCAT:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dataset</strong>: A collection of data, often structured and published in various forms or versions. It is the abstract representation of data.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution</strong>: A specific <strong>representation</strong> or <strong>format</strong> of the dataset. This could be a CSV, JSON, Turtle, etc. The same dataset can have multiple distributions, each with a different media type or access URL.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-dcat-differentiates-a-distribution">How DCAT Differentiates a Distribution:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-dcat-differentiates-a-distribution"></a></h3>
<p>DCAT distinguishes between datasets and distributions by associating each dataset with one or more distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dcat:Dataset</strong>: Represents the overall dataset as an abstract entity.</li>
<li><strong>dcat:Distribution</strong>: Represents a specific form in which the dataset is available. Each distribution points to a specific format, access method, or download link.</li>

</code></pre>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>dataset</strong> <code>daveRichardsDataset</code> has two <strong>distributions</strong>: one in <strong>Turtle</strong> format and another in <strong>JSON-LD</strong> format.</li>
<li>Each <strong>distribution</strong> specifies the <strong>format</strong> and provides a <strong>download URL</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion-1"></a></h3>
<p>It is <strong>DCAT</strong> that differentiates a <strong>distribution</strong> by providing properties such as <code>dcat:distribution</code>, which ties a dataset to its various formats or access points. The <strong>dataset</strong> itself remains an abstract concept, while distributions represent the actual downloadable or accessible versions of the dataset.</p>

<p>Yes, in <strong>DCAT</strong> (Data Catalog Vocabulary), <strong>catalogs</strong> can point to other catalogs. DCAT provides mechanisms to describe hierarchical or interconnected catalogs by linking datasets and catalogs across multiple layers.</p>
<p>The relevant property is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dcat:catalog</strong>: This property allows a <strong>dataset catalog</strong> (i.e., an instance of <code>dcat:Catalog</code>) to point to other catalogs.</li>

<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main Catalog</strong> (<code>catalog1</code>) includes both a dataset (<code>dataset1</code>) and a reference to another catalog (<code>catalog2</code>), which in turn contains its own datasets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-case">Use Case:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#use-case"></a></h3>
<p>This feature allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create <strong>federated catalogs</strong> or catalog networks where one catalog aggregates or links to other catalogs.</li>
<li>Organize catalogs hierarchically (e.g., a national catalog that links to regional catalogs).</li>
<li>Implement <strong>catalog discovery</strong> across multiple domains or repositories, making it easier to locate data across distributed systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>This flexibility makes DCAT highly suitable for large or complex data ecosystems where multiple catalogs need to be linked together.</p>
<h2 id="can-dcat-catalogue-name-graphs">can dcat catalogue name graphs?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#can-dcat-catalogue-name-graphs"></a></h2>
<p><strong>DCAT</strong> (Data Catalog Vocabulary) does not explicitly provide support for <strong>named graphs</strong>. DCAT is focused on describing datasets, catalogs, and distributions, where a <strong>dataset</strong> refers to a collection of data and a <strong>distribution</strong> refers to the concrete format or access method for that data.</p>
<h3 id="workaround-for-named-graphs-in-dcat">Workaround for Named Graphs in DCAT:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#workaround-for-named-graphs-in-dcat"></a></h3>
<p>You can, however, model <strong>named graphs</strong> indirectly by treating each <strong>named graph</strong> as a separate <strong>distribution</strong> or <strong>dataset</strong> within DCAT. If a named graph represents a specific subset or version of a dataset, you can describe it as a distribution of a dataset.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how you might represent a named graph as a distribution:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">dataset1</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">dcat<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Dataset</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>

</code></pre>
<p>In this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>named graph</strong> is treated as a specific <strong>distribution</strong> of the dataset, and its format is specified (e.g., N-Quads, which supports named graphs).</li>
<li>The <strong>downloadURL</strong> points to the resource where the named graph is available.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="custom-extension">Custom Extension:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#custom-extension"></a></h3>
<p>If named graphs are central to your use case, you could extend DCAT with custom properties or leverage <strong>RDF Data Cube</strong> vocabulary or <strong>VoID</strong> (Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets), both of which are better suited for representing fine-grained RDF data structures, including named graphs.</p>

<p>could <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">@base (Private)</a> be used flexibly somehow, like to make RDF data more transposable? I'd like to be able to for a dataset or entire catalog, host it on a semantic flow site at the github user or organization of my choosing, and not have to manually replace all the prefixes and IRIs in every file.</p>
<ul>
<li>chatgtp:</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, you can use <strong><code>@base</code></strong> in RDF Turtle files to make the data more <strong>transposable</strong> by allowing flexible handling of IRIs across different hosting environments, such as when moving datasets or catalogs between GitHub organizations or users. Here's how it could work:</p>
<h3 id="using-base-flexibly-for-transposable-rdf">Using <code>@base</code> Flexibly for Transposable RDF<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#using-base-flexibly-for-transposable-rdf"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong><code>@base</code></strong> directive in Turtle allows you to define a <strong>base IRI</strong> that serves as a prefix for all relative IRIs in the file. This makes it possible to use <strong>relative IRIs</strong> instead of hardcoding absolute IRIs. By doing this, you can relocate your RDF data without having to change every IRI, making your datasets or catalogs more portable.</p>
<h3 id="example-3">Example:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example-3"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>File Hosted at GitHub</strong>:
Assume your dataset is currently hosted at <code>https://user1.github.io/my-dataset/</code>. You can structure your Turtle file like this:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token keyword">@base</span> <span class="token url"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>https://user1.github.io/my-dataset/<span class="token punctuation">></span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>

<span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Item1</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Thing</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>

    <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">foaf<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">homepage</span></span> <span class="token url"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>/homepage<span class="token punctuation">></span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>&#x3C;/homepage></code> resolves to <code>https://user1.github.io/my-dataset/homepage</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transposing to Another Hosting Location</strong>:
If you move the dataset to a different GitHub user or organization, say <code>https://org2.github.io/my-dataset/</code>, you only need to update the <strong><code>@base</code></strong> directive in the file, without changing the rest of the IRIs:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token keyword">@base</span> <span class="token url"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>https://org2.github.io/my-dataset/<span class="token punctuation">></span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the relative IRI <code>&#x3C;/homepage></code> will resolve to <code>https://org2.github.io/my-dataset/homepage</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="transposing-entire-catalogs">Transposing Entire Catalogs:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#transposing-entire-catalogs"></a></h3>
<p>If you're working with <strong>catalogs</strong> that contain multiple files, you can apply this concept at the catalog level as well. Use relative paths within your RDF data files and only adjust the base IRI in each file. By doing so, your entire catalog becomes more <strong>portable</strong> when moved between hosts or locations, with minimal manual adjustments.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-3">Benefits:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#benefits-3"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portability</strong>: You can move your datasets or catalogs across different GitHub repositories, or even other hosting platforms, with minimal changes.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Management</strong>: No need to manually update each IRI inside your RDF files; just adjust the <code>@base</code> directive.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Relative IRIs remain consistent and function as expected regardless of where the dataset is hosted.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach ensures that your RDF files remain flexible and easily transposable, which is especially useful when using platforms like GitHub where the hosting URL may change depending on the user or organization managing the repository.</p>

<h3 id="scenario">Scenario:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#scenario"></a></h3>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it Works:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-it-works"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The relative IRIs, such as <code>&#x3C;dataset1/dist/ttl></code>, remain unchanged, but their resolution changes based on the updated <code>@base</code>.</li>
<li>By updating the base IRI in both the <strong>catalog</strong> and <strong>dataset files</strong>, all references (e.g., <code>downloadURL</code> and <code>distribution</code> links) now point to the new hosting location at <code>https://org2.github.io/catalog/</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages-1">Advantages:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#advantages-1"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimal Effort</strong>: No need to manually replace IRIs throughout the file. Just change the <code>@base</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Portability</strong>: The catalog and its datasets can be moved to any other hosting platform or GitHub organization by updating just the base.</li>
<li><strong>Modular Structure</strong>: Each dataset can maintain its own base IRI, making it easier to manage them separately or host them in different subdirectories.</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure helps make RDF catalogs <strong>highly transposable</strong>, providing flexibility for managing datasets across various hosting environments with minimal effort. Let me know if this approach fits what you're aiming for!</p>
<h2 id="it-seemse-like-you-could-prefix-ex-">it seemse like you could "@prefix ex: <ns>"</ns><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#it-seemse-like-you-could-prefix-ex-"></a></h2>
<p>You're right that you can use a <strong>relative IRI</strong> in a <strong><code>@prefix</code></strong> definition, like this:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token keyword">@prefix</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">ex<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span></span> <span class="token url"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>ns<span class="token punctuation">></span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>&#x3C;ns></code> is a <strong>relative IRI</strong> that will be resolved against the current <strong><code>@base</code></strong>. This means the relative IRI <code>&#x3C;ns></code> in the <code>@prefix</code> declaration is treated as a relative reference, and it will be expanded based on the <strong><code>@base</code></strong> IRI.</p>

<p>Here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>@base</code> defines <code>https://example.org/base/</code> as the base IRI.</li>
<li>The <code>@prefix ex: &#x3C;ns/></code> defines the prefix <code>ex:</code> with a <strong>relative IRI</strong>. This is resolved relative to the base IRI, so <code>ex:item1</code> will expand to <code>https://example.org/base/ns/item1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, you can indeed use a relative IRI in <code>@prefix</code>, and it will be resolved according to the current <code>@base</code>. This allows for a flexible and concise way to define prefixes while making the RDF more transposable.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="4-context">4. <strong>Context</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#4-context"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Although this has a broader meaning, it can imply a reference to the environment or conditions in which something is relevant. It might work as a synonym when the dataset or link provides situational relevance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-key">5. <strong>Key</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#5-key"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Can be used to indicate something essential for accessing or unlocking something, like a <strong>key</strong> to access a particular dataset or resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re specifically looking for terms in the context of RDF or data catalogs, "citation" or "context" could work well depending on the framing.</p>

<p>Using <strong>"key"</strong> as a level of redirection between the name (IRI) and the dataset(s) or graph(s) that represent it could be a powerful way to implement composability in your system. Here's how this concept might work:</p>
<h3 id="key-as-a-redirection-mechanism">Key as a Redirection Mechanism:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#key-as-a-redirection-mechanism"></a></h3>
<p>A <strong>key</strong> could act as an intermediary between the IRI that identifies an entity and the various datasets, graphs, or even other entities that define or extend it. This redirection would enable dynamic composition or swapping of datasets without needing to alter the IRI itself. By modifying the key, you could alter the datasets or graphs referenced, allowing flexibility in how entities are composed or represented.</p>
<h3 id="example-use-case">Example Use Case:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example-use-case"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Key as an Entity Composer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An entity identified by <code>https://example.org/Person1</code> could have a <strong>key</strong> like <code>https://example.org/Person1/key</code>, which points to datasets or graphs representing different aspects of the entity (e.g., demographic data, social connections).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key might point to different datasets based on context (e.g., a public-facing dataset versus a more detailed internal dataset).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Composability with Keys</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keys can allow you to compose an entity from multiple datasets or graphs. For instance, one dataset might describe the physical properties of an entity, while another describes its social relationships. By managing these connections through the <strong>key</strong>, the entity remains composable and flexible without hard-coding the links in its IRI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="advantages-of-using-a-key">Advantages of Using a Key:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#advantages-of-using-a-key"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>: You can decouple the <strong>entity</strong> (identified by its IRI) from the specific datasets or graphs that describe it. This keeps the entity's identity stable while allowing the underlying data to be flexible.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning and Context</strong>: Keys can point to different datasets or graphs depending on the context or version needed, giving you fine-grained control over how and when data is used.</li>
<li><strong>Composability</strong>: You can aggregate multiple datasets or graphs to represent an entity in different ways, depending on what is necessary for a particular task or query.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this concept of using <strong>keys</strong> for redirection and composition sound like it fits your needs?</p>

Any reason it couldn't be used to compose datasets, "current pointers", or catalog composition?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#owlimports-any-reason-it-couldnt-be-used-to-compose-datasets-current-pointers-or-catalog-composition"></a></h2>
<p>Using <strong><code>owl:imports</code></strong> for composing <strong>datasets</strong>, <strong>"current pointers"</strong>, or <strong>catalog composition</strong> is technically possible, but there are some important considerations to keep in mind:</p>
<h3 id="how-owlimports-works">How <strong><code>owl:imports</code></strong> Works:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-owlimports-works"></a></h3>
<p>In <strong>OWL</strong>, the <code>owl:imports</code> property is primarily used to <strong>import entire ontologies</strong> into another ontology. When one ontology imports another via <code>owl:imports</code>, it essentially merges all the axioms (classes, properties, etc.) from the imported ontology into the importing ontology. This is useful for building modular ontologies and ensuring that definitions from external ontologies are included.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-for-datasets">Challenges for Datasets:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#challenges-for-datasets"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Designed for Ontologies, Not Datasets</strong>: 
<ul>
<li><strong><code>owl:imports</code></strong> is optimized for <strong>ontologies</strong>, not datasets. In practice, this means it's designed to bring in <strong>schema-level</strong> information (concepts, classes, and properties) rather than large volumes of <strong>instance data</strong> (like datasets). This could lead to inefficiencies or challenges when working with large, data-heavy RDF files or catalogs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Importing Data</strong>: 
<ul>
<li>While <strong><code>owl:imports</code></strong> could technically be used to bring in data, it's not the most common or efficient approach. Other RDF-based methods, like <strong>SPARQL</strong> and <strong>named graphs</strong>, or tools such as <strong>DCAT</strong> (for dataset composition), are typically better suited for managing datasets and catalogs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="possible-use-cases-for-owlimports">Possible Use Cases for <strong><code>owl:imports</code></strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#possible-use-cases-for-owlimports"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Composing Ontologies for Data Structure</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could use <strong><code>owl:imports</code></strong> to bring in <strong>shared ontology modules</strong> that define the schema for datasets. For example, if different datasets need to conform to a common structure (e.g., they all use the same class definitions or property constraints), <strong><code>owl:imports</code></strong> could be useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Current Pointers" or Dataset Composition</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In principle, you could use <code>owl:imports</code> to create a dataset or catalog that points to other datasets via imports. For example, the "current" dataset could import a specific version of another dataset. This would allow you to update or change the source data without needing to modify the main dataset directly. </li>
<li>However, this would be unconventional and might lead to confusion, as <code>owl:imports</code> is meant for schema-level reuse and reasoning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="better-alternatives-for-dataset-or-catalog-composition">Better Alternatives for Dataset or Catalog Composition:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#better-alternatives-for-dataset-or-catalog-composition"></a></h3>
<p>For <strong>dataset composition</strong>, there are more appropriate mechanisms than <code>owl:imports</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DCAT</strong> is designed specifically for <strong>composing datasets and catalogs</strong>. It provides mechanisms for linking datasets, distributions, and catalogs, which makes it better suited for your goal of managing datasets, versioning, and catalogs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SPARQL and Named Graphs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Named graphs</strong> allow you to manage different datasets within a single RDF store, and you can use <strong>SPARQL</strong> queries to compose data dynamically from multiple named graphs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom RDF Schemas for Versioning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could create a custom RDF-based schema that includes properties for linking different versions of datasets or pointing to the "current" version, without needing to rely on <code>owl:imports</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion-2"></a></h3>
<p>While <strong><code>owl:imports</code></strong> could theoretically be used to import or compose datasets, it is not ideal for this purpose. It’s better suited for importing ontology schemas rather than large volumes of data. For managing datasets, catalogs, and "current pointers," tools like <strong>DCAT</strong> and <strong>SPARQL</strong> are more appropriate and flexible options. </p>

<li><strong>Parent Catalog</strong>: The parent catalog (<code>https://example.org/catalog</code>) references a <strong>sub-catalog</strong> and one of its own datasets.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Catalog</strong>: The sub-catalog (<code>https://example.org/sub-catalog</code>) contains its own datasets, demonstrating how catalogs can point to other catalogs, allowing for hierarchical or modular data structures.</li>
<li><strong>Composability</strong>: The parent catalog can point to both individual datasets and other catalogs, allowing for flexible and modular data composition.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>dcat:Catalog</code></strong>: Used to define catalogs of datasets.</li>
<li><strong><code>dcat:Dataset</code></strong>: Represents individual datasets.</li>
<li><strong><code>dcat:distribution</code></strong>: Links a dataset to its various distributions (formats, versions).</li>
<li><strong><code>dcat:downloadURL</code></strong>: Provides the URL where the distribution can be accessed.</li>
<li><strong><code>dcat:catalog</code></strong>: Allows catalogs to refer to other catalogs, creating a hierarchical structure.</li>

<li><strong>Modular Data Systems</strong>: Organize datasets into catalogs, which can reference other catalogs, creating flexible data systems.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning and Formats</strong>: Manage datasets with multiple distributions across formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, RDF) or versions.</li>
<li><strong>Linked Data Catalogs</strong>: Compose datasets by linking them across various catalogs, facilitating discoverability and reuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach using <strong>DCAT</strong> makes it easier to manage and compose datasets, especially when dealing with multiple formats, versions, and catalogs.</p>

<p>Both of your examples use catalogs, which I'm not sure I like. It feels like you should be able to compose a dataset of other datasets directly. DCAT's "dataset series" doesn't seem quite right either because it has a sense of the elements of the series being similar and perhaps sequential. My idea is that entities have related datasets to hold (all?) their data. Entities become simple names or keys, like in entity component systems.</p>

<h2 id="dave-1">dave<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dave-1"></a></h2>
<p>I believe a distribution is essentially a distributable version of a dataset, in a specific format. So every distribution should have a corresponding dataset. But the big problem I see with your example is that <a href="https://example.org/entity/123">https://example.org/entity/123</a> but it's supposed to be an entity. It exemplifies the issue I was trying to convey to you yesterday, i.e., differentiating a thing from the data that represents it. I don't want to say that an entity is a dataset. I want to provide you with an example that includes multiple files, how should I specify the different files for you? Should I open multiple canvases?</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-1">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-1"></a></h2>
<p>I understand your requirements better now—you want to <strong>distinguish the entity</strong> from the dataset or datasets that represent it, without conflating the <strong>entity</strong> itself with the data. To help demonstrate this concept with multiple files, I think it will be best if I open <strong>multiple canvases</strong>, each representing a different Turtle file or data section. That way, we can visualize how the entity, dataset, and related files can interact without mixing up the roles.</p>
<p>I'll split your request into several components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Entity Definition</strong>: A Turtle file that defines the entity itself.</li>
<li><strong>Dataset Metadata</strong>: Another Turtle file that holds metadata about the dataset(s) related to the entity.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution Files</strong>: Turtle files representing different dataset versions and distributions.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll prepare these in separate canvases to clearly show how they can relate while maintaining distinctions between <strong>entity</strong>, <strong>dataset</strong>, and <strong>distribution</strong>.</p>
<p>Let me start drafting these components for you.</p>
<p>I've provided three separate Turtle files across different canvases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Entity Definition File (<code>entity_definition</code>)</strong>: Defines the <strong>entity</strong> (<code>ex:Person123</code>) as a <code>foaf:Person</code>. This entity has basic attributes, like a name and an email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dataset Metadata File (<code>dataset_metadata</code>)</strong>: Defines a <strong>dataset</strong> (<code>ex:Person123Dataset</code>) that describes <code>Person123</code>. It contains multiple <strong>distributions</strong> (<code>ProfileDist</code> and <code>StatsDist</code>), each linking to specific downloadable representations of the entity's data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entity Component Data File (<code>entity_component_data</code>)</strong>: Describes a more modular dataset for <code>Person123</code> that includes different <strong>aspects</strong> (profile and social data). This allows for managing various datasets related to the same entity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In these examples, I've kept the <strong>entity</strong> (<code>ex:Person123</code>) separate from the <strong>datasets</strong> that describe it. Each dataset or distribution points back to the entity using <code>dct:subject</code>, clearly distinguishing the <strong>entity</strong> from the data about it. </p>
<p>This setup allows the entity to remain a <strong>simple key</strong>, while the different datasets provide the full representation, much like an entity-component system.</p>
<p>Let me know if this aligns with your needs or if you'd like to refine these examples further!</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#kosmion-dev-1012" title="kosmion dev 10/12">kosmion dev 10/12</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#regarding-5-im-thinking-to-supplant-class-membership-with-facets-andor-aspects-the-kosmion-ontology-itself-might-use-class-hierarchies-but-id-like-it-to-use-relators-too-if-that-ends-up-making-sense" title="regarding #5, I&#x27;m thinking to supplant class membership with facets and/or aspects.

This allows for greater flexibility in modeling relationships, and you’re considering avoiding OWL Full for now while continuing to refine the approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImmutability \u0026#x26; Bitemporality\u003c/strong\u003e: You’ve moved towards making Kosmion immutable with bitemporality using both 'system-time' (aka 'transaction-time') and 'valid-time' for temporal modeling. You're exploring the idea of system-time as external metadata that governs immutability, while valid-time is treated as internal data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNaming and Metadata\u003c/strong\u003e: You've been working on a naming convention, leaning towards terms like 'genesis' and 'tombstone' (or 'relator-genesis' and 'relator-tombstone') to represent the birth and death of statements, and preferring 'relator-' as a prefix for metadata. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlash-Based IRIs\u003c/strong\u003e: You're using slash-based IRIs for the Kosmion ontology, establishing a namespace (\u003ccode\u003ehttps://kosmion.github.io/ont/v0/\u003c/code\u003e) to structure the ontology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMetadata vs. Data\u003c/strong\u003e: You clarified that metadata will not use relators.

Replacing class membership with facets and/or aspects could give more flexibility, especially if emergent properties can dynamically represent membership or classification based on context.

This is often referred to as \u003cstrong\u003ereified relations\u003c/strong\u003e because the relationship is treated as a first-class entity (a relator) in the ontology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"structure-of-relators\"\u003eStructure of Relators:\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#structure-of-relators\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn DOLCE, a relator relates multiple entities by connecting them through \u003cstrong\u003eroles\u003c/strong\u003e.

It feels like you should be able to compose a dataset of other datasets directly. DCAT's \"dataset series\" doesn't seem quite right either because it has a sense of the elements of the series being similar and perhaps sequential. My idea is that entities have related datasets to hold (all?) their data. Entities become simple names or keys, like in entity component systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"chatgpt\"\u003echatgpt\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chatgpt\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"a-thing-is-not-a-dataset\"\u003ea thing is not a dataset\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#a-thing-is-not-a-dataset\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"dave-1\"\u003edave\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#dave-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe a distribution is essentially a distributable version of a dataset, in a specific format. So every distribution should have a corresponding dataset. But the big problem I see with your example is that \u003ca href=\"https://example.org/entity/123\"\u003ehttps://example.org/entity/123\u003c/a\u003e but it's supposed to be an entity. It exemplifies the issue I was trying to convey to you yesterday, i.e., differentiating a thing from the data that represents it. I don't want to say that an entity is a dataset. I want to provide you with an example that includes multiple files, how should I specify the different files for you? Should I open multiple canvases?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"chatgpt-1\"\u003echatgpt\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#chatgpt-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand your requirements better now—you want to \u003cstrong\u003edistinguish the entity\u003c/strong\u003e from the dataset or datasets that represent it, without conflating the \u003cstrong\u003eentity\u003c/strong\u003e itself with the data. To help demonstrate this concept with multiple files, I think it will be best if I open \u003cstrong\u003emultiple canvases\u003c/strong\u003e, each representing a different Turtle file or data section. That way, we can visualize how the entity, dataset, and related files can interact without mixing up the roles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'll split your request into several components:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEntity Definition\u003c/strong\u003e: A Turtle file that defines the entity itself.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDataset Metadata\u003c/strong\u003e: Another Turtle file that holds metadata about the dataset(s) related to the entity.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDistribution Files\u003c/strong\u003e: Turtle files representing different dataset versions and distributions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'll prepare these in separate canvases to clearly show how they can relate while maintaining distinctions between \u003cstrong\u003eentity\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003edataset\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003edistribution\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me start drafting these components for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI've provided three separate Turtle files across different canvases:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEntity Definition File (\u003ccode\u003eentity_definition\u003c/code\u003e)\u003c/strong\u003e: Defines the \u003cstrong\u003eentity\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003ccode\u003eex:Person123\u003c/code\u003e) as a \u003ccode\u003efoaf:Person\u003c/code\u003e.
