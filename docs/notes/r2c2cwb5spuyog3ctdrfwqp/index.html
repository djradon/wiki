<p>I don't think I'll live up to "brilliant ontologist", but here goes:</p>
<p>First of all, what's the problem? Computing human-written text.</p>
<p>What's the problem domain? Story. In other words: intentionally written text. By that, I mean text that was written to express some arbitrary meaning. This is smaller than the set of all possible written text, because no one intentionally writes anything that is exclusively nonsensical.</p>
<p>So what's my solution? I call it the Story Empathizer.</p>
<hr>
<p>Every time someone writes text, they encode meaning into it. This even happens on accident: try to write something completely random, and there will always be a reason guiding your result. I call this the original Backstory. This original Backstory contains all of the information that is not written down. It's gone forever, lost to history. What if we could dig it up?</p>
<p>Backstory is a powerful tool. To see why, let's consider one of the most frustratingly powerful features of Story: ambiguity. In order to express a unique idea in Story, you don't need an equivalently unique expression! You can write a Story that literally already means some other specific thing, yet somehow your unique meaning still fits! Doesn't that break some mathematical law of compression? We do this all day every day, so there must be something that makes it possible. That thing is Backstory. We are full of them. In a sense, we are even made of them.</p>
<p>We can never get the original Backstory back, but we can do the next best thing: make a new one. How? By reading Story. When we successfully read a Story, we transform it into a new Backstory. That goes somewhere in the brain. We call it knowledge. We call it memory. We call it worldview. I call this process Empathy.</p>
<p>Empathy is a two way street. We can use it to read, and we can use it to write. When two people communicate, they each create their own contextual Backstory. The goal is to make the two Backstories match.</p>
<hr>
<p>So how do we do it with a computer? This is the tricky part. First, we need some fundamental Backstories to read with, and a program that uses Backstory to read. Then we should be able to put them to work, and recursively build something useful.</p>
<p>I envision a diverse library of Backstories. Once we have that, the hardest part will be choosing which Backstory to use, and why. Backstories provide utility, but they come with assumptions. Enough meta-reading, and we should be able to organize this library well enough. The simple ability to choose what assumptions we are computing with will be incredibly useful.</p>
<hr>
<p>So that's all I've got so far. Every time I try to write a real program, my surroundings take over. Software engineering is fraught with assumptions. It's very difficult to set aside the canonical ways that software is made, and those are precisely what I'm trying to reinvent. I'm getting tripped up by the very problem I intend to solve, and the irony is not lost on me.</p>
<p>Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. I know this idea is pretty out there, but if it works, it will solve NLP, and factor out all software incompatibility.</p>
