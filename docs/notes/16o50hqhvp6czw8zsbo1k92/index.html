<ul>
<li>relations can become exponentially complex, derived from the simple triple format. To express the natural relations between entities, the knowledge graph often uses compound phrases. However, facing hundreds of relations like song_of, written_by, create_by, is_author_of, build_time, cause_by, has_been_to, and has_visited, humans can become confused by the ambiguity, let alone machines. This is why it is sometimes necessary to define the domain and range if you expect certain relations to belong to specific classes. Consumers must first understand the concept and relation definition of the KG. However, as relations grow from different sources, they become increasingly ambiguous with one another, such as belongs_to, part_of, and included_by.</li>

<ul>
<li>the KG creator, in turn, has to define complex relations with the compound phrase for accurate description</li>
<li>"We should not blame that developers sometimes question would it be more straightforward if we can design a relational database table. When you employ a relational database with a table name called ‘president’, you can easily define the properties that belong only to this table like name, x_th, period, spouse, spouse_period, etc. And this concept oriented design, in general, is more accessible and human-understandable than RDF oriented design."</li>

<li>KG is currently the most promising technology that shares similarities with human thinking.</li>
<li>There are no other alternative technologies that can sustain hope for the next breakthrough, especially after the advancements of deep learning from the connectionism community.</li>
<li>We acknowledge that there is a compromise between symbolism researchers and connectionism researchers.</li>
<li>Technology media often prioritize propaganda over accountability, and researchers may not face consequences for making grandiose claims.</li>

<h2 id="suggestions">Suggestions<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#suggestions"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Technically, there is a need to strike a balance between the simplicity of triple formats and the information richness of n-tuple structures in representing knowledge. While technologies like Neo4j are moving in this direction, there is a need for a new standard that involves researchers and developers in defining a schema and n-tuple knowledge that can be easily understood and accessed by both humans and machines.</li>
<li>While URI is considered a vital requirement for ensuring global uniqueness, cheaper alternatives could be used instead. For example, universally unique identifier (UUID) is a widely known identifier that can be used to identify entities both locally and globally. UUIDs can ensure that entities from different datasets remain globally unique even when merged. Thus, we can use UUIDs to replace URIs for identifying entities and predicates with little impact.</li>

<li>In my career, I've transitioned from Knowledge Graph to Entity Component System - an  <a href="/wiki/notes/EHe5gy8iGwSWZFMwymjar">ECS</a>can be quickly implemented using existing scalable, robust data technologies (e.g. RDBMS), and components/attributes represented as vectors/columns and matrices/dataframes/tables are more useful in data analysis/science (and other software) contexts.</li>

To express the natural relations between entities, the knowledge graph often uses compound phrases. However, facing hundreds of relations like song_of, written_by, create_by, is_author_of, build_time, cause_by, has_been_to, and has_visited, humans can become confused by the ambiguity, let alone machines. This is why it is sometimes necessary to define the domain and range if you expect certain relations to belong to specific classes. Consumers must first understand the concept and relation definition of the KG.
