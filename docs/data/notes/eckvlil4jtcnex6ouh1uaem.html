<ul>
<li>the phrase that we “play in” an adventure as op- posed to playing a board game wherein we just “play it” separates the two forms as distinct concepts</li>
<li>An open system can create, animate and inform a multiplicity of extensible systems while this is never true with a closed system. </li>

<ul>
<li>directed play with mutable rules intimately leagued with open play forms with no conceptual boundaries. 
<ul>
<li>It brought with it a need to create resources for it to be played, either in pre-game design sessions or during the game itself by way of its participants being able to instantly extrapolate upon what was being conceptualized. </li>

</li>
<li>merger of conceptual and mechanical systems
<ul>
<li>resulting “super-system” is in systems theory parlance comprised of non-linear and linear (and/or isolated) systems that have standing relationships with each other. </li>
<li>mechanics often come into focus when there is a need to ascertain the probabilities for success of a player’s interactions within the fantastic surround</li>

<ul>
<li>predominated by mechanics and hard-fast and immutable rules.</li>
<li>growing presumption that GM-created game matter was now the province of “professional creators” 
<ul>
<li>users were being incrementally disfranchised from D&#x26;D’s original creative crucible as mere consumers of those creations. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>whatever the GMs proposed to their players was being ignored by the latter for scaling up their characters to defeat more and more powerful adversaries</li>
