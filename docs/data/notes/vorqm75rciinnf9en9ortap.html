<li>the spectators are not placed in front of a narrative unfolding in a linear progression.</li>
<li>The narrative premise is to actively explore the extents of the playing area in an attempt to reach its edges and unravel the story.</li>
<li>In that regard the story is presented to you as a puzzle, and it is for you the participant to piece it together in your own unique way. You experience the story as though you are part of the story, following the protagonist on a pathway to achieving their goal.</li>
<li>The use of suspense and anxiety can be used to guide an audience member through the narrative. By removing the participant from their comfort zone, their actions and reactions become influenced by both their instincts and the prompts that the storytelling experience gives them, creating a profound sense of non-cognitive ‘phenomenological’ immersion. Meanwhile the act of experimentation with the narrative structure and the temporal order of reception leaves the participant questioning their own subjective conclusion of the events they just experienced.</li>
