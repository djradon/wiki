<p>"it is relatively rare for a dataset to be a unitary thing which be downloaded in its entirety. More typically the non-realtime datasets we see comprise a series of updates (annual, quarterly, monthly etc as determined by some release cycle). Where possible we provide data services and dumps for the whole series. However, both users and publishers want to explicitly see the series of updates as individual elements they can separately download but regard the collection of those updates as a single dataset with common metadata and want the data, and presentation of it, to reflect that."</p>
