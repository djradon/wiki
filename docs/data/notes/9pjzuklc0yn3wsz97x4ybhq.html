<li>"Most people learn in private, consuming information, but not creating content themselves.  Learning in Public is the act of creating “learning exhaust” by making the resources you wished you had found while you were learning. This means everything from mapping out the landscape of a new field of interest, to documenting the problems you ran into and how you solved them – all out in the open in order to give back."
