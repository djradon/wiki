## Features

- addresses some of the fundamental challenges in configuring RDF-based systems and offers innovative solutions for resource naming and identification
  - aims to automate the problem of resource naming (aka URI minting) for a specific class of resources, initially and specifically for the resources of an Ontogen service that need to be minted as part of the configuration.
  - With `bog:ref`, a resource initially identified by a blank node can be given a locally valid name.
