<ul>
<li>BDI abstractions </li>
<li>reasoning cycle</li>
<li><strong>Use of Capabilities</strong> – agents aggregate a set of capabilities, which are a collection of beliefs and plans, and allow modularisation of particular agent functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Plan Body is an Extension of JADE Behaviour</strong> – in order to better exploit JADE features, plan bodies are subclasses of JADE behaviours.</li>
<li><strong>Java Annotations</strong> – annotations are provided to allow easier configuration of agent components, without compromising its flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Extension Points</strong> – strategies can be easily implemented to extend parts of the reasoning cycle, such as belief revision and plan selection.</li>
<li><strong>Listeners and Events</strong> – different events (such as events related to goals and beliefs) can be observed in the platform, allowing listeners to react according to events that occurred.</li>
<li><strong>Java Generics for Beliefs</strong> – beliefs can store any kind of information and are associated with a name, and if the value of a belief is retrieved, it must be cast to its specific type, so the use of Java generics allows us to capture incorrect castings at compile time.</li>
