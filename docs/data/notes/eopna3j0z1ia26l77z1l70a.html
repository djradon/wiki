<ul>
<li>Mechanics are the base components of the game - its rules, every basic action the player can take in the game, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a> and data structures in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine" title="Game engine">game engine</a> etc.</li>
<li>Dynamics are the run-time behavior of the mechanics acting on player input and "cooperating" with other mechanics.</li>
<li>Aesthetics are the emotional responses evoked in the player.
<ul>
<li>including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensation</strong> (<em>Game as sense-pleasure</em>): Player enjoys memorable audio-visual effects.</li>
<li><strong>Fantasy</strong> (<em>Game as make-believe</em>): Imaginary world.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative</strong> (<em>Game as drama</em>): A story that drives the player to keep coming back</li>
<li><strong>Challenge</strong> (<em>Game as obstacle course</em>): Urge to master something. Boosts a game's replayability.</li>
<li><strong>Fellowship</strong> (<em>Game as social framework</em>): A community where the player is an active part of it. Almost exclusive for multiplayer games.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> (<em>Game as uncharted territory</em>): Urge to explore game world.</li>
<li><strong>Expression</strong> (<em>Game as self-discovery</em>): Own creativity. For example, creating character resembling player's own avatar.</li>
