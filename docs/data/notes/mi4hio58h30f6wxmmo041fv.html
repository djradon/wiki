<ul>
<li>memory-maker listens to your story, pulls out concepts; can listen to how others see you</li>
<li>people, places, time, feelings, x, y</li>
<li>makes a graph, like a concept heatmaps</li>
<li>retells in different styles</li>
<li>take memories and out and share them; the world becomes the source for your proxi</li>
<li>the proxi can be "embodied", say, into a game of survivor with your friends;</li>
<li>why a world? above a certain number of items, a zoomable spatial interface is much more usable. makes it more tangible; conceptual things are next to each other; </li>
<li>the more memories, the better? two-three dozen is where it gets useful; at 100 it tapered off. importance is well-served with the zoomable as well;</li>
