<ul>
<li>This work describes the Agile and Continuous Integration for Modular Ontologies and Vocabularies (ACIMOV) ontology engineering methodology for developing ontologies and vocabularies. ACIMOV extends the SAMOD agile methodology to (1) ensure alignment to selected reference ontologies; (2) plan module development based on dependencies; (3) define ontology modules that can be specialized for specific domains; (4) empower active collaboration among ontology engineers and domain experts; (5) enable application developers to select views of the ontology for their specific domain and use case. ACIMOV adopts the standard git-based approach for coding, leveraging agility and DevOps principles. It has been designed to be operationalized using collaborative software development platforms such as Github or Gitlab, and tooled with continuous integration and continuous deployment workflows (CI/CD workflows) that run syntactic and semantic checks on the repository, specialize modules, generate and publish the ontology documentation.</li>

<ul>
<li>O1 The ontology must align to reference IoT ontologies;</li>
<li>O2 The ontology must be modular, including modules that cover knowledge common to all IoT platform components;</li>
<li>O3 The ontology must reuse some identified ontologies for the application domains at stake;</li>
<li>O4 The ontology must have a homogeneous and predictable structure, such that similar concepts for different domains are described the same way;</li>
<li>O5 Different alternative representations must be possible to account for the need to manipulate small knowledge graphs in constrained devices;</li>
<li>O6 One must be able to select a subset of the ontology (a view) that covers the needs of a specific application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="methodological-requirements">Methodological Requirements<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#methodological-requirements"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>M1 Agile principles must be adopted to improve collaboration between ontology engineers, domain experts, and end-product owners, with short cycles, and working increments;</li>
<li>M2 Regular meetings with all parties must be held to help prioritizing the requirements stemming from use cases, and choosing the target for the next iteration;</li>
<li>M3 Regular meetings among ontology engineers must be held, to help prioritizing the modules to work on, and ensuring work on different modules can be led in parallel;</li>
<li>M4 Collaborative software development platforms with code versioning and issue tracking shall be adopted;</li>
<li>M5 DevOps principles must be adopted to enable continuous integration and deployment of the ontology artifacts (e.g., ontology modules, documentation, examples)</li>

<p>Many ontology engineering methodologies have been proposed over time, including <a href="/wiki/notes/tdd1o2b3gecn2cnttgk9prj">Methontology</a> [ 9], On-To-Knowledge [ 10], DILIGENT [ 11 ], the “Ontology Development 101” [ 12], NeOn [ 13]. Some directly transpose software engineering methodologies, for example UPON Lite [ 14] is based on Rational Unified Process. The LOT methodology [ 15] adopts a V-model approach with conditional feedback at upstream development stages. Other early methods pro- posed to rely and align with existing ontologies to bootstrap new ontologies as in SENSUS [16 ]. More recently, methodologies are inspired by the principles of Agile software engineering, which promote collaboration between developers and stakeholders by producing regular updates of the product1. Among these methods, AMOD [ 17 ] and CD-OAM [ 18 ] are based on SCRUM. AMOD is the first method that describes the cycle of ontology development in a SCRUM sprint. CD-OAM enriches AMOD by describing the management the ontology commitment user community. XPOD [ 19 ] and eXtreme ontology method [ 20] are based on eXtreme Programming. The Lean Ontology Development (LOD) [21] is inspired by the Lean approach: Build-Measure- Learn. SAMOD [ 1 ] is revisiting the motivating scenarios and competency questions of Uschold and Gruninger [22], additionally considering ontology modules and test-driven development.</p>
<h3 id="git-and-cicd-for-ontology-engineering">Git and CI/CD for ontology engineering<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#git-and-cicd-for-ontology-engineering"></a></h3>
<p>Before the democratization of these frameworks, a few preliminary approaches such as VoCol [ 23 ] or OnToology [ 24] were proposed in the ontology engineering community using Github applications2. <a href="/wiki/notes/4j5savydfbqam7x8zwbsgfr">Ontology Development Kit</a> (ODK) [ 25] uses Travis CI to run workflows with the ROBOT tool [ 26 ] developed by the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) community. CI/CD pipelines are reported for the publication of different ontologies, such as the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) in [ 27], the International Data Spaces Information Model (IDSA) in [ 28], and the CASE Cyber Ontology3. Specific Github actions are available on the Github marketplace for running RDFLint4, validating RDF syntaxes5,6, or validating RDF files against SHACL shapes7 or ShEx [29].</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#methodology"></a></h2>
<p>Step 1 Collect requirements and identify reference ontologies.
Step 2 Review meeting (an event)
Step 3 Select relevant modules from reference ontologies
Step 4 Manage modelet backlog
Step 5 Modelet development meeting (an event)
Step 6 Develop and test modelets
Step 7 Integrate modelet and release ontology artifacts</p>
