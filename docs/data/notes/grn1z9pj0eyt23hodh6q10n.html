<p>Objects of Desire.</p>
<p>These are not just whimsical wants or fleeting desires, they are the driving forces that propel the narrative forward and deepen the audience's engagement with the characters.</p>
<p>Let's break this down the Objects of Desire into three distinct categories:</p>
<h3 id="objects-of-desire">Objects of Desire<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#objects-of-desire"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Conscious Want</li>
<li>Unconscious Need</li>
<li>Eternal Desire</li>
</ul>

<li>Conscious Want: The Clear, Visible Goal</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what the character knows they’re trying to achieve. It’s like having a quest in a game with a clear objective: “Win the race” or “Get the treasure.” The character is fully aware of this goal, and it drives their immediate actions.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen’s Conscious Want is simple: survive the games. Every action she takes, from forming alliances to setting traps, is about staying alive.
In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Harry’s Conscious Want is to stop Voldemort from getting the Sorcerer’s Stone. It’s a tangible, immediate goal that he understands and works toward.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Unconscious Need: The Deeper, Hidden Growth</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what the character doesn’t realize they need. It’s like a personal quest they didn’t know they were on. Often, this is a lesson or growth they need to undergo to become a better version of themselves. While the Conscious Want drives their actions, the Unconscious Need pushes them toward personal transformation.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>In Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth Bennet’s Conscious Want is to marry for love, not status. But her Unconscious Need is to overcome her pride and prejudice to truly connect with Mr. Darcy.
In The Great Gatsby, Gatsby’s Conscious Want is to reunite with Daisy, but his Unconscious Need is to recognize the emptiness of chasing wealth and status. He needs to understand that the life he’s built around Daisy is hollow.
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Eternal Desire: The Ultimate Aspiration</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the character’s deepest, most profound motivation—their why. It’s what they hope to achieve in the grand scheme of things, even if they can’t fully express it. It’s like the big picture goal that gives meaning to everything else. Think of it as what you’d want written on your tombstone—your legacy.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>In The Lord of the Rings, Frodo’s Conscious Want is to destroy the ring, but his Eternal Desire is to restore peace and return to the simple life in the Shire. He longs for normalcy after chaos.
In Jane Eyre, Jane’s Conscious Want is to find love and independence. Her Eternal Desire, though, is to live a life where she can maintain her integrity and self-respect, without sacrificing her morals for love or status.
