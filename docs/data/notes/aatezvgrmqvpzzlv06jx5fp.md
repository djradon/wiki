## Highlights

- AllegroGraph takes an extraordinarily long time to populate. Marklogic is overshadowed by AllegroGraph but still takes 2 minutes to load the data in RDF/XML format!
- Stardog does not optimise federated queries adequately.
- Virtuoso has the worst interface.

## Conclusions

* GraphDB for development while you are constructing your application.
* AnzoGraph or Virtuoso when you move into production if speed is important.
