- "I have succeeded mostly by restricting action to jobs and methods in which I was unlikely to fail"
- "I may have been lucky to avoid for so long the academic psychology that was then laid out in most textbooks. These would not then have guided me well with respect to cults and were often written as if the authors were collecting psychology experiments as a boy collects butterfliesâ€”with a passion for more butterflies and more contact with fellow collectors and little craving for synthesis in what is already possessed."
- "Psychological tendencies tend to be both numerous and inseparably intertwined, now and forever, as they interplay in life."
