<p>For almost two decades now, the Uniﬁed Foundational Ontology (UFO) has been the focus of a long-term research program on ontological foundations for conceptual modeling. UFO (Guizzardi, 2005; Guizzardi et al., 2015b) was developed by consistently putting together theories from formal ontology in philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophical logic. UFO is a <a href="/wiki/notes/iw76z1ood2hqxbh6t3uokm6">Four Category</a> ontology that addresses fundamental conceptual modeling notions via a set of micro-theories, including: –a theory of types and taxonomic structures (Guizzardi and Wagner, 2004a; Guizzardi et al., 2021) that is connected to a theory of object identiﬁers, including a formal semantics in a sortal quantiﬁed modal logic (Guizzardi, 2015); –a theory of part-whole relations (Guizzardi, 2007, 2009, 2011; Guizzardi et al., 2016); –a theory of particularized intrinsic properties, attributes and attribute value spaces (Guizzardi et al., 2006; Guizzardi and Zamborlini, 2014), which includes a view on datatypes as semantic reference structures (Albuquerque and Guizzardi, 2013); –a theory of particularized relational properties and relations, (Guarino and Guizzardi, 2015, 2016; Guizzardi and Wagner, 2008; Fonseca et al., 2019), including a proposal for Weak Truthmaking (Guarino et al., 2019) connecting particularized properties to propositions; –a theory of roles (Guizzardi, 2005, 2006; Masolo et al., 2005); –a theory of events (Guizzardi et al., 2013a; Almeida et al., 2019; Benevides et al., 2019b; Guarino and Guizzardi, 2016; Benevides et al., 2019a; Guizzardi et al., 2016), including aspects such as event mereology, temporal ordering of events, object participation in events, causation, change, and the connection between events and endurants via dispositions; –a theory for multi-level modeling (Carvalho et al., 2017, 2016; Guizzardi et al., 2015a; Fonseca et al., 2021a)</p>
