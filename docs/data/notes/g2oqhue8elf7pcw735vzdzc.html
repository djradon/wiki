<li>"If your application frequently performs heavy computation for very long durations, then virtual threads may be a bad fit to begin with because your system may easily become overcommitted by orders of magnitude."</li>
<li>"If you're using SQLite or RocksDB, think carefully before adopting virtual threads."</li>

<p>"Performance Management and Scalability:</p>
<p>  Java Virtual Threads: They are designed to be lightweight and highly scalable, especially for IO-bound tasks. The JVM manages these threads efficiently, allowing for the creation of thousands to millions of concurrent threads with a much lower memory footprint compared to traditional threads.
Deno Web Workers: While powerful for CPU-bound tasks and parallel processing, each worker is a heavier construct compared to a Virtual Thread. This means that while they're excellent for offloading intensive tasks, they might not be as scalable as Virtual Threads for handling many small, concurrent tasks.</p>
<p>Concurrency Model:</p>
<p>  Java Virtual Threads: They offer a straightforward model for writing concurrent code, similar to traditional threading but with a much lower overhead. This makes them ideal for applications with a large number of concurrent, mostly idle tasks.
Deno Web Workers: They follow a message-passing model which can be more robust in terms of avoiding shared state problems, but it might require a different way of thinking about problem-solving, particularly for those used to shared-state concurrency models."</p>
