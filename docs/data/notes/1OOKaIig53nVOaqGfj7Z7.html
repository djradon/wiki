<li><a href="/wiki/notes/wtr8mkilwzti5y5o9jp03dm">@chatgpt.4o</a>: "a predicate is the position in the triple, and a property is the resource that occupies that position."</li>
<li>properties: predicates or attributes
<ul>
<li>but it's a fuzzy line. <a href="/wiki/notes/shscpg9o0q2jpcz2hz6n02z">Demystifying Owl for the Enterprise</a> says dates are attributes, like "created", because it's a literal... but you can (and <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">gd (Private)</a> does) represent dates and times as entities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>one of the biggest mistake of RDF: predicates are ??
<ul>
<li>2021-11-07 don't remember what I was going to say here, but likely something about how predicates supposedly express properties, when really they just express predicates (i.e., part of a property)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"In RDF, a predicate is something that is in the second position of a triple. RDF have no way of referring to positions in triples, so you cannot use a property between two predicates. What is certainly meant by the OP is "can we use owl:sameAs between two properties". Properties can be identified with IRIs, IRIs can occur anywhere in a triple, subject and object can be related by way of a predicate, and any IRI are allowed in any position of a triple. So, syntactically speaking, it is allowed to relate two properties with owl:sameAs."</li>

<ul>
<li>2021-11-07 : the predicate kinda corresponds to the "attribute" part of "attribute-value pairs"; property feels like it should correspond to a concrete attribute-value pair, not just a predicate. </li>
<li>some classes have default "getter/setter" verbs, that's kinda properties. so I can see "The predicate indicates a binary relation, also known as a property."</li>
<li>"The predicate indicates a binary relation, also known as a property."
<ul>
<li>this is the kinda opposing what I've been thinking: the relation is the property, as opposed to the resource</li>
