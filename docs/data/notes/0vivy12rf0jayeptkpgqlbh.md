- similar to [[prdct.twingate]] or [[prdct.strongdm]] ?
  - they're relay-based
- contractors shouldn't get full subnet access, so it's down to the service
- no whitelisting of endpoint
- jumphost is cloud host
- pricing model is $25/user/mo, endpoints are unlimited; contractors etc are "shared" for free
- has "openvpn" use case, when you don't want publicly available VPN endpoint.
- most customers looking to get off public endpoint
- support the relay use case, but p2p is a differentiator
