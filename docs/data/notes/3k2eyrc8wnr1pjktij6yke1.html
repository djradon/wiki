<ul>
<li><a href="http://purl.org/net/VideoGameOntology#Item">http://purl.org/net/VideoGameOntology#Item</a> does differentiate between abstract items from one that is actually encountered
<ul>
<li>the example of "Potion" is more like ItemType</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://purl.org/net/VideoGameOntology#LoseEvent">http://purl.org/net/VideoGameOntology#LoseEvent</a> doesn't differentiate between an agent losing something and a character losing something. 
<ul>
<li>superclasse GameEvent says "GameEvent describes an event that takes place in a game without straight player interaction" but a LoseEvent example is "a player can lose a character due to trade with another player"</li>
