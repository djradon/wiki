<p>What would be the best ways to represent the two cases of the following sentence in RDF-star:
Alice heard that Bob knew that Cindy read, from email and in paper, that Dan adores Eve
i.e.,
Alice heard []
|
Bob knew []
|
Cindy read {from email; in paper} []
|
Dan Adores Eve</p>
<p>Case 1: The only asserted triple should be: Alice heard <something>. All the remaining triples (i.e., those that make up the <something> portion) should be quoted triples only (i.e., not asserted triples).</something></something></p>
<p>Case 2: Every triple used to represent this sentence should be an asserted (i.e., not just quoted) triple.</p>
<p>Thanks,
