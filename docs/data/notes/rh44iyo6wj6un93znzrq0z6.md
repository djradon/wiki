## Solutions

### Creation

- [[prdct.dungeon-fog]]
- [[prdct.Dungeon-Draft]]

### Import

## Issues

- UVTT files can not contain animated content, nor individually selectable map images/tokens. The map itself is a single flat image.
- "I'm sure megasploot had input from other VTT developers to get the file type suitable for everyone's needs, but a lot of the data is quite specific and useful to Foundry, but not so much for other systems. "
