### Dynamic Client-Side

- the HTML (mostly index.html) for each entity/graph/dataset/catalog might access a text-based data source that specifies which template to use, which data to incorporate (via catalog processing), and then write the response dynamically. 
  - maybe the data source is the default graph for the entity, or a special dereference-page graph
- Users could also customize their views and save those setting in a cookie, that would be integrated into the page
