<p>Mieke Bal, a prominent cultural theorist and critic, has developed a framework for analyzing narratives that includes various elements such as focalization, time, and presentation. In her work, particularly in <em>Narratology: Introduction to the Theory of Narrative</em>, Bal discusses <strong>presentation</strong> as part of how narratives are structured and conveyed to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="bals-definition-of-presentation">Bal's Definition of Presentation:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#bals-definition-of-presentation"></a></h3>
<p>In the context of <a href="/wiki/notes/qmuayvny4zzcgdm7bjrh56d">@mieke-bal</a>'s narratology, <strong>presentation</strong> refers to the way in which the story is conveyed to the audience through the narrative text. It encompasses the choices made in the narrative's discourse that affect how the story is perceived, including aspects of narration, focalization, and style. Presentation is concerned with the <em>how</em> of storytelling—how the events of the story are presented to the reader or viewer, rather than just what happens in the story (which is the <em>what</em> or the content).</p>
<h3 id="key-aspects-of-presentation-in-bals-framework">Key Aspects of Presentation in Bal’s Framework:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#key-aspects-of-presentation-in-bals-framework"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Narration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrator</strong>: The voice or entity through which the story is told. The presentation involves decisions about who the narrator is (first-person, third-person, etc.), their level of knowledge, and their reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Narrative Voice</strong>: The tone, style, and perspective through which the narrator conveys the story. This affects the mood and atmosphere of the narrative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focalization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focalization</strong>: The perspective through which the events of the story are presented. This involves whose perspective the story is filtered through, which can significantly affect how the story is interpreted. Presentation in this context includes how the focalizer's viewpoint shapes the narrative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temporal Presentation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Order and Duration</strong>: Presentation also includes how time is managed in the narrative. This involves decisions about the sequence of events (whether they are presented chronologically or non-linearly) and the pacing of the narrative (how much time is devoted to different events).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stylistic Choices</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language and Style</strong>: The choice of language, literary devices, and stylistic elements are also part of presentation. These choices influence how the narrative is perceived, including the use of metaphor, symbolism, and other rhetorical techniques.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="summary">Summary:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary"></a></h3>
<p>In Mieke Bal’s narratology, <strong>presentation</strong> refers to the manner in which a narrative is constructed and delivered to the audience. It involves the choices related to narration, focalization, temporal structuring, and stylistic elements, all of which shape how the story is perceived and understood. Presentation is a critical aspect of narrative analysis because it influences the reader’s experience and interpretation of the story.</p>
