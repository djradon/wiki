<ul>
<li>Now, technically, there is no such thing as "skill check". There is n ability check, that can be done either using just an ability by itself, or using a specific skill related to that ability. Those are called "skill checks" in the informal vernacular, and are not actually called that in the books.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ability checks are, simply put, is when you want to do something to the world around you - climb a tree, lift a boulder, hide in the darkness, seduce a dragon, etc. Now, saving throws, following that same analogy, are made when the world is doing something to you - a trap opens under your feet, a spell is being cast on you, you ingest poison, etc. </p>
