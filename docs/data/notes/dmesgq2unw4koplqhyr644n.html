<h3 id="player-best-practices">PLAYER BEST PRACTICES<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#player-best-practices"></a></h3>
<p>First: Do you need a map?</p>
<p>If you’re a dungeon delver, only make a map if you feel like you’re getting value from it. There are plenty of smaller dungeons and dungeon-like environments where you won’t need a map. (On the other hand, if you’re having fun making the map, then have fun! That’s reason enough.)</p>
<p>Second: Focus on functionality over trying to capture the precise measurements and angles of the dungeon.</p>
<p>In fact, in many cases, you don’t need measurements at all. You can get most or all of the benefits of mapping from a simple network map: Just draw a circle for each room and then draw lines showing how it connects to other rooms.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you need to give up on the graph paper entirely, of course. It just means recognizing that most of the time the difference between a hallway that’s twenty-five feet long and a hallway that’s thirty feet long just isn’t important.</p>
<p>Of course, there may be times when you actually need that type of precision. (For example, you might suspect that there’s a secret room hidden somewhere in the haunted house and you want to figure out where it might be.) When that happens, make a point of seeking that precision in character: What is your character actually doing to get the precise measurement that you want?</p>
<p>Third: Map in pencil.</p>
<p>You’re going to make mistakes. As you explore and revisit sections of the dungeon, your knowledge of how everything fits together will grow over time. You’ll want to be able to easily adjust your maps to make all the pieces fit together.</p>
<p>Fourth: Let the GM see your map.</p>
<p>If the GM can easily see your map — e.g., it’s sitting on the table in front of you — it will let them quickly notice errors and give you the necessary corrections.</p>
<p>Don’t expect the GM to fix all of your mistakes, of course. Just the ones that you wouldn’t have made if you were actually standing in the dungeon instead of just listening to a description of it.</p>
<p>Fifth: Make sure to actually USE the map.</p>
<p>This might seem obvious, but your goal is to not to produce an immaculate cartographical masterpiece. Take notes directly on the map, and make sure you’re sharing the map with the rest of the group as a reference and resource for decision-making: Where have we been? Where should we be going? What do we know? What do we want to find out?</p>
<p>Sixth: The map is an artifact that actually exists in the game world.</p>
<p>You’re mapping in the real world just like your character is mapping in the game world. Make sure your character has the supplies they need to actually make the map. Think about where and how the map is being stored.</p>
<p>These are small details, but you’ll find they make a big difference in letting the map literally draw you into your character.</p>
<p>Seventh: Try not to let your mapping disrupt or distract from the rest of the game.</p>
