<li>Reputation Libraries</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Reputation Data represents the most fundamental building blocks of our reputation system. To facilitate computations with and access to these building blocks, we package them as pluggable, swappable libraries that allow communities to articulate and iterate on their culture with ease. Such structures also allow for computation on reputation data across contexts. </li>

<li>The Reputation Interchange</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The interchange co-ordinates cross-membrane access to reputation data through a consent driven process. In other words, a neighbourhoods, or micro-community can articulate their culture using reputation data that is being generated across neighbourhoods as well as their own community. </li>
<li>From an agents perspective the interchange serves as a switchboard that allows them to control their reputation data as they hop across micro-collectives. More details about the process, and the channels that data is ported through are outlined in subsequent sections.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="3">
<li>Reputation Scores</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Reputation data from across contexts is computed within a neighbourhood to generate what is known as a 'Reputation Score'. Reputation scores are calculated locally, in a specific neighbourhood, which means they are contextual, and not universally imposed as absolute snapshots of reality. </li>
