<ul>
<li>Fransincar et al. proposed an extension of the OWL-DL language, called tOWL [49], for representing time and changes in an ontology. tOWL uses a subset of OWL-DL whose foundation is the logic SHIN (D). This logic is sufficiently expressive and is decidable for a sound and complete reasoning algorithm [45]. The time domain of tOWL handles both instants and intervals that are modeled by rational numbers and a set of partial order relations over them. As a result, an actual time instant, an interval or Allen’s temporal relations [4] are all converted to rational number-based equivalent instants or relations. </li>
<li>For modeling changing values, tOWL employs the 4D Fluents model, i.e., perdurantist’s view [73]. tOWL is conceptualized as a layered approach. The foundation layer is OWL-DL and the extended con- crete domain is the second layer. Time representation is at the third layer, which is defined by the concrete domain.</li>
<li>OWL reduces the proliferation of objects by
differentiating types of fluents as FluentObjectProperty and FluentDatatypeProperty. For a Fluent-
DatatypeProperty, which relates a time slice to a typed value, three triples can be saved due to that
the time slice is not needed for a typed value.</li>
