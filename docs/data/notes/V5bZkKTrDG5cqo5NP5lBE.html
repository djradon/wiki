<li>" RDF has a pure graph structure at a low-level but is often a confusing mess at a high level, while property graphs are the opposite"</li>
<li>jettisoning URLs in favor of local identifier becomes an ever more serious impediment — throwing away universal, uniform, dereferenceable identifiers in the age of the web looks less and less wise. </li>
<li>"property graphs will likely fade out as knowledge graphs become adopted by enterprises and incorporated into their infrastructure — a well defined schema is not an optional"  </li>

<li>"class hierarchies and typed properties are by far the most useful and important mechanisms for defining the structure of a graph"</li>

<li>the big problem [with reusing terms from well-known vocabularies] is that the well-known ontologies and vocabularies such as foaf and dublin-core that have been reused, cannot really be used as libraries in such a manner. They lack precise and correct definitions and they are full of errors and mutual inconsistencies [1] and they themselves use terms from other ontologies — creating huge and unwieldy dependency trees. If, for example, we want to use the foaf ontology as a library, we need to also include several dozen dependant libraries, some of which no longer exist. So, the linked data approach, in fact, just uses these terms as untyped tags — there is no clear and usable definition of what any of these terms actually mean — people just bung in whatever they want — creating a situation where there are effectively no reliable semantics to any of these terms.</li>
