<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>can customize pretty much everything in this game: The story, the locations, the items, the creatures/allied creatures/characters, the magic spells and effects created by everything, and even the graphics <a id="fnref-1" class="fnref" href="#fn-1">1</a></li>
<li>All in one package without you having to resort to a bunch of separate programs, to do every individual thing, and to hunt through forums and websites for assets to build your RPG with, like you have to do with most modern RPG creators today.</li>
<li>allows up to four players to play the game simultaneously, using hot seat</li>
<li>I can't tell you how many competitive adventures I built with this game, where each player was experiencing a different part of the adventure, and it was designed to bring them all together, in a titanic battle to the finish, in the big climactic ending. You don't see that at ALL in ANY modern RPG builders.</li>
