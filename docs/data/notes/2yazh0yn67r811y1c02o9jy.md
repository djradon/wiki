- everything that exists has some physical aspect, but some physical systems have sub-systems that support "a-physical things", and it can be useful to speak of those as universes of their own and abstract away the "physical-prime" context (that is kinda boring because it subsumes everything else). Call them sub-universes or subcontexts, eg., brains, computers, networked games.
