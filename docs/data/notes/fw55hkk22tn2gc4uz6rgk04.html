<p>The MULTI 2022 Collaborative Comparison Challenge was created to promote in-depth discussion between multi-level modeling approaches. This paper presents a comparison of DeepTelos- and DMLA-based solutions in response to the challenge. We first present each approach and solution separately, and then list the similarities and differences between the two solutions, discussing their relative strengths and weaknesses.</p>
