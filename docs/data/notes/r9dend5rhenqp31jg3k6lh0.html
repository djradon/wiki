<h2 id="approach">Approach<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#approach"></a></h2>
<p>In contrast to conventional approaches, which are mostly agent-centered, MaDKit follows an organization-centered approach (OCMAS): There is no predefnied agent model in MaDKit.</p>
<p>Especially, MaDKit does not enforce any consideration about the internal structure of agents, thus allowing a developer to freely implements its own agent architectures.</p>
<p>So, MaDKit is built upon the AGR (Agent/Group/Role) organizational model: Agents play roles in groups and thus create artificial societies.</p>
