<ul>
<li>defining a model in GAML amounts to defining a model species, which later allows to instantiate a model agent (aka a simulation), which may or may not contain micro-species, and which can be flanked by experiment plans in order to be simulated.</li>
</ul>
<p>This conceptual structure is respected in the definition of model files, which follows a similar pattern:</p>
<pre><code>Definition of the global species, preceded by a header, in order to represent the model species
Definition of the different micro-species (either nested inside the global species or at the same level)
Definition of the different experiment plans that target this model
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Since simulations, or experiments, are represented by agents, GAMA is bound to support high-level model compositionality, i.e. the definition of models that can use other models as inner agents, leveraging multi-modeling or multi-paradigm modeling as particular cases of composition.
The visualization of models can be expressed by models of visualization, composed of agents entirely dedicated to visually represent other agents, allowing for a clear separation of concerns between a simulation and its representation and, hence, the possibility to play with multiple representations of the same model at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agent-oriented modeling paradigm means that everything "active" (entities of a model, systems, processes, activities, like simulations and experiments) can be represented in GAML as an agent (which can be thought of as a computational component owning its own data and executing its own behavior, alone or in interaction with other agents).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any species can be nested in another species (called its macro-species), in which case the populations of its instances will imperatively be hosted by an instance of this macro-species. A species can also inherit its properties from another species (called its parent species), creating a relationship similar to specialization in object-oriented design. In addition to this, species can be constructed in a compositional way with the notion of skills, bundles of attributes and actions that can be shared between different species and inherited by their children.</p>
