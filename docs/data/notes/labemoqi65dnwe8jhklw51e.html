<p>This work presents a fully elaborated ontology, defined via the Ontology Web Language (OWL), of the Business Process Model and Notation (<a href="/wiki/notes/mmytejxznjmj3oakm472yzd">Bpmn</a>) standard to define business process models, and we demonstrate that any BPMN model can be serialized as OWL file. Based on ontological analysis and a corresponding definition of a modeling notation as ontology we show that business process models can be transformed from one notation into another one as long as there are common underlying concepts; this is demonstrated with the case of an actor based, or subject-oriented, view on business processes. Furthermore, a reference architecture for Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) based on microservices is discussed which is capable of executing actor based business process models. As a transformation of BPMN models into the actor based view is generally possible, also BPMN models could be enacted. As a result, we can conclude that the actor system is a promising way to stimulate new ways to design workflow management systems and to design business process modeling languages which are more comfortable to use by non-experts without losing necessary expressiveness. Another result is that an ontology is a productive way to define a modeling notation as it can be used as knowledge base, it is a formal conceptualization of the underlying notions, and can be semantically enriched for further use.</p>
