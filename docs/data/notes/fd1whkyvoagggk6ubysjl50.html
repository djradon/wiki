<li>dave: Remember: I'm trying to develop a static-site generator called "Semantic Flow" that takes ontologies defined in RDF and/or conforming RDF data files and generates a static site to be hosted on GitHub pages that includes HTML-based index files (that can be based on a template or customized as necessary) that describe identified resources and link to raw RDF data files (possibly in multiple formats) that can be access by semantically-aware applications.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>tried metalsmith-ldschema, underscored the point that the docs folder/site might need some javascript and templates and assets that could interfere with the namespace, so the actual namespace will probably need to live the next level down</li>
<li>got a site to build... it's basically empty because metalsmith-ldschema only generates pages for classes and properties, but still, feeling good.</li>

<ul>
<li>I've been wanting to have a place where people can just make changes directly to the RDF, and the tooling (on commit) copies it to a new version. "current"</li>
<li>I think there's a decision to be made between using the src hierarchy structure and generating the hierarchy; it might be related to the tension between supporting multiple repos.
<ul>
<li>seems like the issue is "distributions", the files have to live in the hierarchy. Unless you just break distribution out of the namespace entirely, but that seems lame</li>
<li>probably doesn't make any sense to call it a namespace-repo any more... the namespaces live under it</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>renamed to <a href="/wiki/notes/c4wo7mdjzcit2bmvqr5sx4u">SFRootRepo</a></li>
<li>instead of duplicating highlights in a NI's index.trig, just define the _default datasets as "highlights" and use owl:imports</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>now thinking about a "terms" hierarchy next to the namespace hierarchy. Names are supposed to be unique. Maybe punning could help</li>
<li>how do we keep a history of the index.trig file? I guess it might change while in development, but once settled, it should very rarely change. 
<ul>
<li>if it does change, perhaps its content could be discovered using the inverse properties from the default and catalog datasets</li>
<li>it might be easiest if everything was a dataset; I mean, everything almost already is, for gods sake. I just can't bear to say that <dave-richardson> a dcat:dataset.</dave-richardson></li>

<li>I was ready to abandon Cliffy and Deno (probably for Gluegun), but the security and dynamicness seem important enough. Turns out Cliffy is great. Lume seems good too.</li>
