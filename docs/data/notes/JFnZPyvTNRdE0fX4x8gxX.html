<p>So, who is to blame for our linear, textual predicament?</p>
<p>The designers who invented the paper-based desktop metaphor that haunts all modern interface design? The users who behave like blind, inconsiderate drunks when presented with any slightly novel note-taking system? The venture capitalists who exclusively fund these predictable apps? The entire educational system for its incessant focus on textual literacy over spatial and visual literacy?</p>
