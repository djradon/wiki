<li>"It's a sort-of-roguelite sort-of-HOMM-like sort-of-fantasy-XCOM
Where characters you play in one campaign ascend to be background/lore characters for following campaigns
The story bits are told as cartoon panels where all the characters look exactly like you designed them, including all equipment (and wounds, mutations, ...) they've picked up
Campaigns have a mix of story quests and side quests randomly picked from a pool of quests written by different authors/quest designers, and the quality of these... varies
but it's all very charming and fun."
