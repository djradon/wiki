<li>"F-logic provides frame-based syntax and semantics. It treats instances, classes,
properties, and methods as objects in a uniform way. For instance, in one context,
the object ostrich can be viewed as a class by itself (with members such as tweety
and fred); in a different context, this object can be a member of another class
(e.g., species). Whether an object functions as an instance or a class depends on
its syntactic position in a logical statement. F-logic does not require instances
and classes to be disjoint"</li>
