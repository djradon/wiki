<pre><code>Psychological Basis: Brentano’s conception of space is rooted in psychological experiences rather than physical or geometric abstractions. He believed that our understanding of space comes from the way we perceive objects and their spatial relations.

Intuitive and Non-Metric: Brentano’s space is intuitive and qualitative rather than metric and quantitative. It focuses on the relational aspects of space as directly experienced, such as adjacency, containment, and separation, rather than measurable distances and angles.

Topological Properties: Brentano’s spatial theory emphasizes topological properties (properties that remain unchanged under continuous transformations). This includes concepts like continuity, boundary, and connectedness.

Non-Extensional: Unlike traditional Euclidean space, which is extensional and involves precise measurements and coordinates, Brentano space is non-extensional, focusing on how space is experienced and understood subjectively.

Concept of Spatial Parts: Brentano also discussed the notion of spatial parts and wholes, which ties into his mereological (part-whole) theories. He was interested in how parts of space relate to each other and to the whole.

<p>In modern ontological frameworks, Brentano’s ideas have influenced the way some spatial concepts are treated, particularly in foundational ontologies that aim to incorporate human cognitive and perceptual aspects of space.
Mereotopology</p>
<p>Brentano's ideas are closely related to mereotopology, a field that combines mereology (the study of parts and wholes) with topology (the study of spatial properties preserved under continuous transformations). Mereotopology is concerned with the relationships between parts, wholes, and boundaries within a given space.
Examples in Upper Ontologies</p>
<p>Modern upper ontologies that incorporate aspects of Brentano's ideas might focus on:</p>
<pre><code>Topological Relations: Relations such as connectedness, boundaries, and interiors of spatial regions.
Mereological Relations: How parts of space relate to each other and to larger wholes.

<p>Example: DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering)</p>
<p>DOLCE incorporates aspects of Brentano’s spatial theory by focusing on qualitative spatial relations.</p>
