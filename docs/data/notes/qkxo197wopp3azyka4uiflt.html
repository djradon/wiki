<p><a href="/wiki/notes/evkzii7zc2zx5mn8wudmhab">Zeebe</a> and <a href="/wiki/notes/tfl0enmuzqgc8lfb1f5ljx7">Activiti</a> are both popular open-source workflow and business process management (BPM) engines, but they cater to slightly different use cases and have distinct architectures and features.</p>
<h3 id="zeebe">Zeebe:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#zeebe"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microservices-Oriented</strong>: Zeebe is designed with microservices in mind. It is a distributed, horizontally scalable workflow engine that can handle high throughput and large volumes of workflow instances.</li>
<li><strong>Event-Driven</strong>: Zeebe is built for event-driven architectures, making it well-suited for modern cloud-native applications where workflows are triggered by events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance and Scalability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Throughput</strong>: Zeebe is designed to scale horizontally, meaning it can handle a large number of workflow instances concurrently, making it ideal for high-traffic applications.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud-Native</strong>: Zeebe is optimized for deployment in cloud environments like Kubernetes, where scalability and fault tolerance are critical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Target Use Cases</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event-Driven Microservices</strong>: Zeebe is particularly strong in scenarios where workflows need to be integrated into microservices architectures.</li>
<li><strong>Large-Scale Process Automation</strong>: It’s ideal for applications that require processing thousands or millions of workflow instances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supported By</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zeebe is developed and supported by Camunda as part of the Camunda Cloud platform, which also includes advanced features like monitoring and analytics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="activiti">Activiti:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#activiti"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional BPMN Engine</strong>: Activiti is a more traditional BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) workflow engine. It has a monolithic architecture, although it can be deployed in a microservices architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Java-Based</strong>: Activiti is a lightweight BPMN engine built primarily in Java, making it easy to integrate with Java-based applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance and Scalability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Instance Deployment</strong>: Activiti is designed for deployment in single-instance or clustered environments but doesn’t scale as naturally or horizontally as Zeebe.</li>
<li><strong>Good for Mid-Sized Workflows</strong>: While it performs well for moderate workflow loads, Activiti may face limitations when dealing with very high-throughput environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Target Use Cases</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional BPMN Workflows</strong>: Activiti is well-suited for organizations looking to implement standard BPMN workflows in enterprise applications.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with Java Applications</strong>: Activiti integrates seamlessly with Java applications and is a good choice for Java-heavy environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supported By</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activiti was originally developed by Alfresco and is now maintained by the Activiti community. It has a large user base and many extensions available.</li>

<h3 id="comparison-summary">Comparison Summary:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#comparison-summary"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zeebe</strong>: Best for cloud-native, event-driven microservices architectures that require high scalability and throughput. It is the go-to option for modern, large-scale distributed systems.</li>
<li><strong>Activiti</strong>: Best for traditional BPMN-based workflows, particularly in Java-centric environments. It’s more suited for medium-scale workflows and enterprise applications that don’t require the scale and distribution capabilities of Zeebe.</li>
