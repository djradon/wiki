<p>There are four properties of a simulation language to be checked in its evaluation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Soundness: L is sound w.r.t. DESO iff every element of L has an interpretation in terms of a do- main concept from DESO. The degree of soundness can be measured relatively as the number of L elements that have a DESO interpretation divided by the total number of L elements.</li>
<li>Completeness: L is complete w.r.t. DESO iff every DESO concept is represented by a modeling primitive of L. The degree of completeness can be measured relatively as the number of DESO concepts that are represented by an element of L divided by the total number of DESO concepts.</li>
<li>Lucidity: L is lucid w.r.t. DESO iff every element of L has at most one interpretation in DESO. The degree of lucidity can be measured relatively as the number of L elements that have at most one interpretation in DESO divided by the total number of L elements.</li>
<li>Laconicity: L is laconic w.r.t. DESO iff every domain concept from DESO is represented by at most one element of L. The degree of laconicity can be measured relatively as the number of DESO concepts that are represented by at most one element of L.</li>
