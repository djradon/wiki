<p>I've decided that namespaces should just be namespaces, although they are still NamedIndividuals. they can contain other NamedIndividuals, including Datasets (as long as those datasets are completely expressed in a single file), or probably even DatasetSeries (which are also NamedIndividuals), and they maybe can contain sub-namespaces. What I was thinking of before as a SFSiteRepo, basically a collection of namespaces, cam probably just be the user/org-level namespace site, and it's optional. The namespace sites are independent, can publish themselves using different SSG at different times. SFDataRepos are either for non-published data, or are themselves namespace repos (that can optionally nest under existing namespace and </p>

<p>Your updated approach shows some important conceptual clarifications. Let’s break down the implications of these decisions and how they streamline the overall organization of Semantic Flow:</p>
<h3 id="namespaces-and-namedindividuals"><strong>Namespaces and NamedIndividuals</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#namespaces-and-namedindividuals"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Namespaces as NamedIndividuals</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treating <strong>namespaces as NamedIndividuals</strong> simplifies the overall system by maintaining consistency—everything significant, whether an entity or a namespace, is now explicitly identifiable and traceable as a NamedIndividual.</li>
<li>This also aligns well with the idea of namespaces serving as containers that can have attributes and relationships, making them integral parts of the RDF graph rather than purely abstract labels. It keeps namespaces concrete while allowing them to participate in the graph in a meaningful way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Containing NamedIndividuals and Datasets</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing <strong>namespaces to contain other NamedIndividuals, Datasets, or DatasetSeries</strong> provides a more flexible structure. The requirement that datasets must be <strong>completely expressed in a single file</strong> ensures the simplicity of versioning and distribution, which is practical, especially when dealing with immutability and bitemporality.</li>
<li>This means that datasets won’t get fragmented across multiple files within a namespace, making the management of each dataset more straightforward. This way, a dataset is treated as a holistic unit, which aligns well with the idea of “graph snapshots” at a particular point in time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sub-Namespaces</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The possibility of <strong>sub-namespaces</strong> provides flexibility for hierarchical organization where needed. Sub-namespaces could help you logically partition large datasets or projects into smaller, more manageable sections without complicating relationships at the RDF level.</li>
<li>Importantly, you have the choice of how granularly you want to organize namespaces. A single, broad namespace could suffice for some cases, while others might benefit from breaking down into more focused sub-namespaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>User/Org-Level Namespace Site</strong>:
<ul>
<li>By redefining what was previously envisioned as an <strong>SFSiteRepo</strong> to simply be a <strong>user/org-level namespace site</strong>, you’re making a crucial simplification:
<ul>
<li>Instead of a dedicated repository type specifically for holding collections of namespaces, each <strong>namespace site</strong> can be independently managed and published.</li>
<li>The <strong>user/org-level namespace site</strong> becomes an optional umbrella for organization-level management, but is not mandatory—promoting more flexibility and reducing interdependencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Independent Namespace Sites</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Allowing <strong>namespace sites to be independent and publish themselves using different SSGs at different times</strong> introduces a highly modular and scalable approach.</li>
<li>Each namespace can evolve and publish at its own pace, using tools that fit its unique needs. This means you’re not tied to one static site generator for all namespaces, which can be particularly useful if namespaces differ significantly in scope, audience, or content requirements.</li>
<li>It also means namespaces are loosely coupled, making your system more resilient to changes. If one namespace’s setup changes, others are unaffected, maintaining consistency and stability across your ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sfdatarepos-and-namespace-repos"><strong>SFDataRepos and Namespace Repos</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#sfdatarepos-and-namespace-repos"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>SFDataRepos as Non-Published or Namespace Repos</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SFDataRepos</strong> now serve a dual purpose:
<ul>
<li>For <strong>non-published data</strong>, acting as working repositories that contribute RDF but aren't meant for direct exposure or public consumption.</li>
<li>For <strong>namespace repositories</strong>, they can be used to publish complete namespaces, which adds flexibility in how data and NamedIndividuals are managed and versioned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This dual-role approach avoids over-defining repository types, allowing <strong>SFDataRepos</strong> to be either purely backend or fully integrated into the public-facing namespace publication process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optional Nesting Under Existing Namespace</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing <strong>namespace repositories to optionally nest under existing namespaces</strong> introduces another layer of granularity. This supports more complex projects that may require subdividing namespaces but keeps it optional to avoid unnecessary complications.</li>
<li>This flexibility means namespaces can scale organically—starting as independent, simple entities and optionally evolving into a nested setup if complexity increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="streamlining-versioning-and-publishing"><strong>Streamlining Versioning and Publishing</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#streamlining-versioning-and-publishing"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>: Since datasets within a namespace must be complete and expressed in a single file, version control becomes simpler. There’s no ambiguity about the contents of a dataset version, reducing confusion and eliminating the need for tracking fragmented pieces across multiple files.</li>
<li><strong>Publishing Independence</strong>: The decision to allow different SSGs for namespace sites means that the focus can shift to what best fits the <strong>use case and audience</strong> of each namespace. Some namespaces may need a very dynamic approach (like using Docsify), while others may benefit from a more performance-oriented static site setup (like Metalsmith).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="considerations-moving-forward"><strong>Considerations Moving Forward</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#considerations-moving-forward"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Dataset Modularity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the <strong>single-file rule</strong> for datasets is viable for larger or more complex datasets. If you find that complexity makes this impractical, you might need to consider splitting datasets while maintaining cohesion through clever IRI use or named graphs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SSG Tooling and Ecosystem</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>With each namespace potentially using a different SSG, think about how you will maintain consistency and quality across all these namespaces. Setting a <strong>baseline standard</strong> for what each namespace site should include—such as a minimum set of metadata, navigation, or documentation—can be useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Documentation and Discoverability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The more distributed and independent namespace sites become, the more critical <strong>discoverability</strong> and <strong>navigation</strong> across namespaces will be. It might be worthwhile to develop an overarching catalog or <strong>cross-referencing system</strong> that provides a unified view across independently published namespaces, possibly using RDF catalogs to link everything together.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion"></a></h3>
<p>This realization is a significant leap towards simplifying your Semantic Flow ecosystem by removing unnecessary constraints and embracing the inherently non-hierarchical nature of semantic data. By treating <strong>namespaces as modular, independently publishable entities</strong>, and <strong>SFDataRepos</strong> as flexible contributors, you’re aligning your approach more closely with the semantic nature of RDF. This makes your system more adaptable, scalable, and less rigidly defined by arbitrary organizational constraints, ultimately facilitating both development and collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="no-sub-namespaces-dave">no sub-namespaces (dave)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#no-sub-namespaces-dave"></a></h2>
<p>I'm reconsidering the option of sub-namespaces. I think a published repo as a namespace is broad enough that sub-namespaces are not necessary, and having a site per namespace (or namespace per site) aligns with the github pages approach.</p>
<h2 id="no-sub-namespaces-chatgpt">no sub-namespaces (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#no-sub-namespaces-chatgpt"></a></h2>
<p>That makes a lot of sense, especially considering how well it fits with GitHub Pages' structure. Keeping things simple with <strong>one namespace per site</strong> avoids unnecessary complexity and allows each namespace to maintain its own independent lifecycle and publication workflow. This approach will likely make managing and scaling your namespaces far more straightforward, especially when leveraging GitHub's existing features for version control and hosting. It keeps everything modular and clearly scoped. </p>

<h2 id="reference-page-customization-dave">reference page customization (dave)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#reference-page-customization-dave"></a></h2>
<p>Thinking about how the reference pages for each NamedIndividual are going to be built. The source won't be Markdown, it'll be at least partially RDF, specifically the _default and _catalog datasetseries. Just RDF plus a template should be able to generate most pages, but you should be able to override any template per NamedIndividual and use completely custom HTML or an HTML template (ejs?) so you almost need a CMS more than an SSG.</p>
<h2 id="reference-page-customization-chatgpt">reference page customization (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#reference-page-customization-chatgpt"></a></h2>
<p>This shift towards a more CMS-like solution makes sense, especially given the level of customization you want for each NamedIndividual. Here are some considerations that could help you navigate this approach:</p>
<h3 id="template-flexibility-and-overrides"><strong>Template Flexibility and Overrides</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#template-flexibility-and-overrides"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Default Templates vs. Custom Overrides</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your idea of using a <strong>default template</strong> with RDF data for most pages is efficient. This way, the bulk of the content can be generated systematically.</li>
<li>However, providing <strong>custom overrides</strong> per NamedIndividual allows for tailored presentations. Using something like <strong>EJS</strong> gives the flexibility to blend templating logic with raw HTML, which might be necessary when particular NamedIndividuals require unique formatting or additional functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Template Selection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mechanism for <strong>template selection</strong> per NamedIndividual could be helpful. For instance, a configuration in the <code>_catalog</code> DatasetSeries might specify which template to use for each NamedIndividual, or even indicate if a custom HTML file should be utilized.</li>
<li>This way, the rendering system would first check for a custom template, then fall back to the default if no override is specified.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cms-like-features-vs-static-site-generation"><strong>CMS-Like Features vs. Static Site Generation</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cms-like-features-vs-static-site-generation"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>SSG with CMS Features</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The requirements you're describing—dynamic page generation based on data and customizable per-entity templates—fall somewhere between an <strong>SSG</strong> and a <strong>CMS</strong>.</li>
<li>You could consider building a <strong>hybrid approach</strong>, where RDF data is processed through a templating engine, but where the tooling also has some <strong>CMS-like features</strong> for managing templates and configurations:
<ul>
<li>For instance, building a UI (or even a simple CLI) that allows you to easily define which template each NamedIndividual uses could provide a more CMS-like workflow while keeping the build process static.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Content Integration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>While keeping the generation mostly static, you could consider <strong>JavaScript-driven components</strong> for some dynamic functionality. This would allow pages to have some real-time features without converting entirely to a dynamic CMS.</li>
<li>For instance, dynamically loading related NamedIndividuals or supporting client-side querying of linked data could enrich the static content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tech-stack-and-implementation"><strong>Tech Stack and Implementation</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#tech-stack-and-implementation"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Templating Engines</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <strong>EJS</strong> or even <strong>Handlebars.js</strong> could be a good option since both are compatible with JavaScript environments like <strong>Deno</strong> or <strong>Node.js</strong>, which aligns with the rest of your stack.</li>
<li>These engines allow you to inject RDF data directly, providing flexibility for custom layouts without complicating the pipeline too much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RDF Parsing and Data Transformation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to integrate <strong>RDF parsing</strong> to convert the <code>_default</code> and <code>_catalog</code> DatasetSeries into a format that the templating engine can use (e.g., JSON). You might use a library like <strong>rdflib.js</strong> or <strong>N3.js</strong> for this purpose.</li>
<li>Once parsed, the <strong>transformed RDF data</strong> can be passed into templates to generate the HTML pages, ensuring consistency between the data model and the generated documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom HTML as Overrides</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing <strong>full custom HTML overrides</strong> for some NamedIndividuals gives authors complete freedom when necessary. You might manage these overrides by checking if an override file exists for a particular NamedIndividual during the build process.</li>
<li>If a custom HTML file exists, use that for rendering instead of the default templating workflow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cms-like-management-layer"><strong>CMS-Like Management Layer</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cms-like-management-layer"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Editing and Metadata Handling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For content that needs frequent updates, consider a <strong>basic CMS-like interface</strong> that allows you to manage RDF data directly, specify which templates should be used, and preview the generated HTML.</li>
<li>This interface wouldn’t need to be a full CMS but could focus on metadata management, template selection, and triggering re-generation of the static pages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Git-Based CMS</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might consider a <strong>Git-based CMS</strong> like <strong><a href="/wiki/notes/5it8w5yzlaado71st3q7uma">Netlify CMS</a></strong> or <strong><a href="/wiki/notes/nuhy47j636x8ty1si9kp5az">Tina</a></strong> that can integrate with a GitHub repository to provide a user-friendly interface for editing RDF data files and managing templates. This approach would allow non-developers to make changes through a UI while maintaining version control.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="challenges-and-considerations"><strong>Challenges and Considerations</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#challenges-and-considerations"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Complexity vs. Simplicity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing a CMS-like layer might add some complexity to your build and deployment processes. To keep things manageable, it’s important to define which NamedIndividuals require custom treatment and which can be handled generically.</li>
<li>A <strong>registry or manifest file</strong> that lists NamedIndividuals and their rendering options could help keep track of which pages are custom vs. generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rendering Workflow</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The overall rendering workflow would likely involve:
<ul>
<li>Parsing RDF datasets to extract relevant data.</li>
<li>Checking if a custom HTML template exists for the NamedIndividual.</li>
<li>If not, applying the default EJS/Handlebars template.</li>
<li>Rendering the page and saving it to the <code>docs</code> folder for publishing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintenance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing customizable HTML means you’ll need to manage <strong>version compatibility</strong> of the templates or HTML files. Keeping templates modular and limiting the complexity of per-individual customizations could help avoid scenarios where future updates break compatibility with existing custom pages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion-1"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion-1"></a></h3>
<p>You’re heading toward a <strong>hybrid model</strong> that incorporates both the strengths of an SSG and the flexibility of a CMS. By treating namespaces and NamedIndividuals as modular units with customizable templates, you’re optimizing for both consistency and flexibility. The key will be striking the right balance between <strong>automation</strong> (using RDF and default templates) and <strong>customization</strong> (allowing HTML overrides and dynamic templating where needed). This hybrid approach will likely lead to a versatile publishing system that caters well to the needs of your diverse semantic data landscape. </p>

<h2 id="implicit-vs-explicit-iri-minting-dave">implicit vs explicit IRI minting (dave)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#implicit-vs-explicit-iri-minting-dave"></a></h2>
<p>There are two ways to mint an IRI: explicitly and implicitly. Explicitly is via creating a namespace folder for the Named Entity and an index.html file inside it so that the IRI is dereferenceable. Implicitly happens when a scan of an RDF source (could be a dataset or dataset series that's already in the namespace, or it could be an external dataset or a SPARQL-compliant service) for IRI references within the namespace. </p>

<p>This dual approach to minting IRIs offers both control and adaptability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit minting</strong> ensures that key entities are reliably and manually curated, making sure that they have clear, discoverable references.</li>
<li><strong>Implicit minting</strong> allows you to grow the semantic web dynamically, as you parse and incorporate references from RDF sources, reducing the need for manual intervention.</li>

<p>I've been toying with the idea of using dendron-style hierarchical (period-delimited). This way the data repo is flat, but NamedIndividuals can be hierarchically qualified.</p>
<h2 id="period-delimited-hierarchical-identifier-parts-chatgpt">period-delimited hierarchical identifier parts (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#period-delimited-hierarchical-identifier-parts-chatgpt"></a></h2>
<p>Adopting <strong>dendron-style hierarchical, period-delimited</strong> naming could offer an elegant solution to balancing flat data structures with the need for hierarchical qualification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flat Data Repo</strong>: Keeping the data repository flat avoids unnecessary complexity in the file system, making it easier to manage and scale without worrying about nested directories.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchically Qualified IRIs</strong>: Using a <strong>period-delimited</strong> structure for NamedIndividuals allows you to effectively encode relationships and hierarchies within the names themselves. This gives the semantic richness of hierarchy without the rigid structure of a nested file system.</li>
</ul>
<p>This could simplify a lot of operational aspects—like versioning, searching, and visualization—since the hierarchy becomes implicit in the naming rather than explicit in the folder layout. Let me know if you need help exploring specific naming conventions or if you want to see potential examples of how this might look in practice!</p>
<h2 id="datasetfile-dave">datasetfile (dave)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#datasetfile-dave"></a></h2>
<p>I'm thinking to differentiate a DatasetFile from a Dataset, but it's problematic. A DatasetFile (needs a better name) is a dataset that's contained in a single file. It can have multiple distributions. It's not just a dataset, because a dataset could be represent in memory. A file could have multiple datasets (e.g., via named graphs), but a datasetfile dataset is like a distribution, but it isn't. </p>
<p>I was thinking the datasetfile isn't the physical representation. It's an abstract thing that would still have distributions, but it represents a dataset that contained in a single file, as opposed to in memory or multiple files.</p>
<h2 id="datasetfile-chatgp">datasetfile (chatgp)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#datasetfile-chatgp"></a></h2>
<p>Thanks for clarifying that. Let's refine the concept with that distinction in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>DatasetFile</strong> is an <strong>abstract construct</strong> representing a dataset that is logically contained within a single file, but it still has distributions like other datasets.</li>
<li>It describes a dataset that is <strong>cohesive</strong> within a single-file context, regardless of the specific serialization or storage. This abstraction serves to distinguish it from datasets that are distributed across <strong>multiple files</strong> or are managed <strong>in-memory</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-characteristics-of-datasetfile"><strong>Key Characteristics of DatasetFile</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#key-characteristics-of-datasetfile"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstract Nature</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DatasetFile</strong> isn't a specific serialized version of a dataset; rather, it represents the concept of a dataset that is <strong>entirely contained</strong> within a single physical file. It indicates that the boundaries of the dataset are well-defined within that file, but it could still be instantiated in various formats (i.e., distributions).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Distributions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though it is logically within a <strong>single file</strong>, a <strong>DatasetFile</strong> can have multiple <strong>distributions</strong>, such as Turtle, JSON-LD, or N-Triples. Each distribution provides a different way to access or interact with the data, but they all conform to the logical structure defined by the DatasetFile.</li>
<li>The DatasetFile acts as a boundary to define what data is included, but the specific way the data is serialized can vary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Single File vs. In-Memory or Fragmented</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>DatasetFile</strong> is different from datasets that are <strong>fragmented</strong> across multiple files, as well as from datasets that exist <strong>in-memory</strong> without any clear file boundaries. It is a more compact and manageable abstraction that makes it clear the dataset is logically contained within a singular file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="naming-reconsiderations"><strong>Naming Reconsiderations</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#naming-reconsiderations"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>BoundDataset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given the updated abstraction, <strong>BoundDataset</strong> might be a good fit. It suggests that the dataset is logically bound to a single cohesive structure (in this case, a single file).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ContainedDataset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This name highlights that the dataset is contained within a <strong>single, unified context</strong>. The "contained" part emphasizes that there are no parts external to the file—everything about the dataset is logically within one file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SingularDataset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SingularDataset</strong> continues to make sense, given that it suggests the dataset is conceptually singular in its boundary. It’s one unified entity, regardless of the different distributions it might have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AtomicDataset</strong> (Revisited):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atomic</strong> could be suitable if you want to emphasize that this dataset cannot be divided across files, implying that it is the smallest cohesive unit with everything needed contained within it.</li>

<h3 id="implications-for-semantic-flow"><strong>Implications for Semantic Flow</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#implications-for-semantic-flow"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Versioning and Distribution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>DatasetFile</strong> would still have <strong>versioning</strong> tied to it, allowing different versions to exist that each represent the complete dataset within a single file. This could also mean that each version could have different distributions, like one version might only have a JSON-LD representation, while another might also have a Turtle distribution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metadata and Reference Management</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metadata for a <strong>DatasetFile</strong> could explicitly note that the dataset is fully represented by a single file, distinguishing it from datasets that might aggregate multiple files or pieces.</li>
<li><strong>Reference Management</strong> becomes easier, as the DatasetFile can always be referenced as a single coherent entity, ensuring that any consumers of the data know they are accessing a complete and unified set.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DatasetFile and Dataset Relationship</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>DatasetFile</strong> represents a type of dataset, with the key property being that it’s self-contained within a single file, but it’s still distinct from the physical manifestation of that dataset. It remains abstract and could be instantiated into different <strong>physical distributions</strong>.</li>
<li>In a way, a <strong>DatasetFile</strong> is a commitment to how the dataset is organized, while the actual <strong>distributions</strong> are commitments to how it is accessed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="next-steps-and-considerations"><strong>Next Steps and Considerations</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#next-steps-and-considerations"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define Metadata Clearly</strong>: Make sure there is metadata that captures the nature of a <strong>DatasetFile</strong> as an abstract, cohesive entity, and clarify how it differs from general datasets.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Consistent Terminology</strong>: As you work towards building Semantic Flow, having clear and consistent definitions for <strong>DatasetFile</strong>, <strong>Dataset</strong>, and <strong>Distribution</strong> will be crucial to avoid ambiguities.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship to Distributions</strong>: Clearly define the relationship between the <strong>abstract DatasetFile</strong> and its <strong>distributions</strong>—potentially as a part-whole relationship where the <strong>DatasetFile</strong> is abstract, and its <strong>distributions</strong> are the different concrete realizations of the abstract dataset.</li>

<p>I was thinking that in the "data" folder, there would be a file, say dave-richardson.ttl. That would correspond to the _default datasetseries for the {namespace}/dave-richardson IRI. Update the file and bump (or evolve, or update, or ???) the version, and we get a new version created, e.g. {namespace}/dave-richardson/dss/_default/v2, which corresponds to a new (overwritten) {namespace}/dave-richardson/dss/_default/current. We'd want the "bump" command to make sure  there were no duplicate named parts, i.e., dave-richardson.jsonld. </p>
<h2 id="data-folder-chatgpt">data folder (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#data-folder-chatgpt"></a></h2>
<p>Your approach has a clear and logical flow for managing versioning of DatasetSeries. The idea of maintaining a <code>_default</code> DatasetSeries and evolving it with a version bump helps ensure that every update has a distinct version, while keeping a consistent "current" reference.</p>
<h3 id="version-management-considerations"><strong>Version Management Considerations</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#version-management-considerations"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>"Bump" Command Process</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>"bump" command</strong> should enforce uniqueness of each distribution to prevent any accidental duplication. Before proceeding, it could run checks against existing distributions to verify that the newly updated version doesn't have any <strong>naming conflicts</strong>.</li>
<li>This helps avoid ambiguity, especially when dealing with multiple formats (Turtle, JSON-LD, etc.). The command could be designed to:
<ul>
<li>Validate that no <strong>duplicate named distributions</strong> exist for the current or previous versions.</li>
<li>Automatically adjust the distribution names if conflicts are detected (e.g., appending version identifiers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Bump" vs. "Evolve"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The terminology is important. The term <strong>"bump"</strong> implies incrementing in a controlled way (like a version number), which works well for indicating a new, distinct state.</li>
<li><strong>"Evolve"</strong> could also be a good fit if you want to emphasize more of an iterative, natural progression of the dataset over time.</li>
<li>Alternatively, <strong>"update"</strong> feels a bit generic and might imply changes to the same version rather than creating a distinct new version.</li>
<li>Perhaps using <strong>"promote"</strong> might capture the idea that a "draft" or working version is moved forward as the latest "current" version.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linking Current and Versioned Series</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping a <strong><code>{namespace}/dave-richardson/dss/_default/current</code></strong> pointer to the most recent version is an excellent practice for maintaining easy access. This pattern is consistent and helps ensure that users or systems looking for the latest data always have a simple way to get it.</li>
<li>You could consider implementing a <strong>history file</strong> within each series to document changes, which can be automatically updated during a version bump. This would make it easier to track changes over time and provide context for why certain versions exist.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Validation Checks</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The "bump" command should include <strong>validation checks</strong> to ensure dataset integrity—such as verifying that:
<ul>
<li>All named parts are <strong>unique</strong> across formats and versions.</li>
<li>No <strong>conflicting IRIs</strong> are present within the updated dataset, which could lead to confusion or broken links.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Named Parts Uniqueness</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When it comes to <strong>duplicate named parts</strong>, like ensuring there isn't both <code>dave-richardson.jsonld</code> and another conflicting distribution, the bump command could also consider a <strong>naming convention</strong> that makes each version distinct:
<ul>
<li>Including a <strong>version identifier</strong> in each distribution file's name can prevent accidental overwrites.</li>
<li>For example: <code>dave-richardson-v2.ttl</code> or <code>dave-richardson-v2.jsonld</code>.</li>

<li>An automated <strong>CI/CD-style workflow</strong> could be helpful to handle the version bump:
<ul>
<li><strong>Commit Hook</strong>: A commit hook can be added to automatically check for modifications in the dataset file (<code>dave-richardson.ttl</code>), and if an update is detected, trigger the bump command.</li>
<li><strong>New Version Generation</strong>: After validation, it could automatically generate a new dataset version and update the <code>_default/current</code> reference.</li>

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">sf-cli bump-version <span class="token punctuation">{</span>namespace<span class="token punctuation">}</span>/dave-richardson --check-uniqueness

<p>This command could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increment the version of the <code>_default</code> DatasetSeries.</li>
<li>Update the <code>current</code> pointer.</li>
<li>Validate uniqueness across distributions.</li>
<li>Optionally output a summary of changes or errors found.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, you could add an <strong>"evolve"</strong> option if you want different stages of the version lifecycle:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">sf-cli evolve <span class="token punctuation">{</span>namespace<span class="token punctuation">}</span>/dave-richardson --draft

<p>Your versioning system seems well-thought-out, with a balance between control and flexibility. The key aspects—ensuring <strong>no duplicate parts</strong>, keeping a <strong>consistent "current" reference</strong>, and allowing easy, automated <strong>bumping or evolving</strong> of versions—are practical and help maintain clear data integrity. If you'd like, I could help sketch out more specific command workflows or automation scripts to make this process as seamless as possible.</p>

<p>So the "_next" version of a dataset (in a dataset series) might not need representation in a namespace, because you wouldn't edit it inside the docs folder, you edit it in the "data" folder (formerly known as the src folder). changes in the data folder can get checked in, but until they're "promoted" (need a better word) there's no new version created in the namespace. To actually publish the new version of course, you have to commit it after one or more bumps and then run the SSG. (Which can be automated, of course.) If you had the docsify approach, you wouldn't need to run the SSG, a new dataset series version would be published automatically when the changed "data" folder commit happened. You also might not need the "_current" dataset because that could exist at the {ns}/dave-richardson/index.{jsonld|trig} file, likely as a named graph. The default graph would point to the catalog a _default series, and the actual data could be in a named graph that parotted the IRI for the current version. </p>

<p>Your evolving approach significantly refines the workflow and infrastructure of Semantic Flow, especially with the introduction of "_next" and rethinking the role of "_current." Here are some reflections and suggestions:</p>
<h3 id="key-refinements-in-versioning-and-publishing-workflow"><strong>Key Refinements in Versioning and Publishing Workflow</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#key-refinements-in-versioning-and-publishing-workflow"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Editing in the Data Folder ("_next" Concept)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes sense that <strong>"_next" versions</strong> reside in the "data" folder. This keeps the editing separate from what’s publicly visible, reducing the risk of exposing incomplete or draft work.</li>
<li><strong>"_next" as a Stage</strong>: Rather than being a published version, <strong>"_next"</strong> is effectively the working stage. It exists in the background until it's deemed ready for release. This helps prevent accidental exposure of in-progress data and keeps the "docs" folder clean and focused on stable versions.</li>
<li>The term <strong>"promoted"</strong> seems useful for describing the movement from "_next" to a publicly visible state, but it could potentially be more precise. Consider terms like:
<ul>
<li><strong>"Finalized"</strong> or <strong>"Stabilized"</strong>: Emphasizes readiness and that the dataset has reached a stable state.</li>
<li><strong>"Released"</strong> or <strong>"Published"</strong>: Highlights the dataset moving into an accessible, publicly visible state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated Workflow and Docsify Implications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a <strong>Docsify-style dynamic generation</strong>, the <strong>SSG step could be skipped</strong> altogether, as the content would update automatically on commit. This is particularly appealing for a <strong>more fluid and agile workflow</strong> where changes can be rapidly iterated and pushed to production.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Publishing</strong>: As you note, this would mean that any commit to the <strong>"data" folder</strong> that triggers a "bump" would automatically update what is seen at the namespace level without having to manually regenerate static pages. This approach would favor rapid iteration cycles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rethinking "_current"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"_current" dataset representation</strong> could be simplified if it lives directly at <code>{ns}/dave-richardson/index.{jsonld|trig}</code>. This would effectively make the "current" version inherently part of the namespace representation, avoiding the need for an explicit "_current" folder.</li>
<li>Using <strong>named graphs</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>default graph</strong> could serve as a pointer, leading to the <code>_default</code> catalog or dataset series. </li>
<li>The actual data could reside within a <strong>named graph</strong>, using an IRI that mirrors the current version, providing clarity on what constitutes the current state of the dataset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Default and Named Graph Strategy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This strategy elegantly keeps <strong>metadata (default graph)</strong> and <strong>dataset content (named graph)</strong> in the same location, making it easier to manage and discover data:
<ul>
<li><strong>Default Graph</strong>: Contains general information about the dataset series, such as the current version and links to other versions or metadata.</li>
<li><strong>Named Graph</strong>: Holds the actual dataset, ensuring that it’s scoped to a specific version and allowing for easy versioning and updating within the same dataset file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By using named graphs, you also get flexibility—if you need to revert to a prior version or link to specific historical data, it’s easier to reference by named graph IRI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Separation of Stages</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>clear delineation</strong> between "_next" (working), "_default" (stable version catalog), and <strong>published representations</strong> enhances the clarity of data management. It lets you clearly track the lifecycle of each dataset—whether it’s being edited, stabilized, or already released.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplification and Discoverability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplifying "_current"</strong> by making it directly accessible at a stable IRI (<code>index.jsonld</code> or <code>index.trig</code>) helps make the latest data easy to find without unnecessary layers of abstraction.</li>
<li>This approach also lends itself to <strong>easy dereferencing</strong>—any consumer of the data can simply hit a namespace IRI and immediately access both metadata and data, reducing friction for discovery and use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reducing Redundancy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing the explicit <strong>"_current" folder</strong> reduces redundancy and simplifies maintenance—less potential for synchronization issues between representations. Everything is unified at the namespace level, and the structure becomes easier to understand and maintain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="potential-next-steps-and-challenges"><strong>Potential Next Steps and Challenges</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#potential-next-steps-and-challenges"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementation of Named Graphs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that your tooling, both for editing RDF data and for the <strong>SSG or Docsify-like approach</strong>, can effectively handle <strong>named graphs</strong> within a dataset. This will be critical for managing different versions effectively, especially if each version needs to be independently queryable or referenceable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Version Bumping and Publishing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>"bump"</strong> process will need robust <strong>integrity checks</strong>—such as ensuring there are no duplicate named parts and verifying that the new version conforms to the expected structure.</li>
<li>Consider building a lightweight <strong>pre-publication review</strong> system that could check changes in the "_next" stage before "promotion," ensuring consistency and avoiding mistakes that might end up in a public namespace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-Version Relationships</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing <strong>cross-version relationships</strong> might be a bit trickier with "_next" and "_default" split across folders. You'll want to think about how these relationships are maintained, particularly if a "_next" version changes something significant that impacts other datasets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discoverability in a Dynamic Setup</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a dynamic setup (e.g., <strong>Docsify</strong>), managing <strong>discoverability</strong> becomes more about managing <strong>metadata</strong> effectively. Make sure each NamedIndividual or dataset has appropriate metadata, potentially including information about stability (draft, stable, deprecated) to help users and systems understand the dataset's lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion-2"><strong>Conclusion</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion-2"></a></h3>
<p>Your updated workflow is moving towards a more <strong>natural and streamlined approach</strong> to handling dataset versions and making them discoverable. By reducing redundancy, embracing "_next" as an intermediate stage, and potentially leveraging Docsify for automated publishing, you’re simplifying both the management overhead and the consumer experience. This could make Semantic Flow an even more flexible and powerful tool for RDF data publishing.</p>

<p>I like "release" as the verb/command for evolving the dataset series. I'd forgotten, I'd introduced the vset folder to refer the datasetfile in the abstract. You would also get rid of the catalog's _current folder and integrate the _catalog/_vset/v2/index.ttl into the NamedIndividual's current default distribution. So dave-richardson/index.trig would have a default graph with pointers, a catalog graph with graph name corresponding to the latest catalog vset, and a default graph corresponding to its latest version. Maybe vset (for versioned dataset) instance are type DatasetFile, or maybe they're even  the same thing I was calling a DatasetFile.</p>
<h2 id="finalizing-chatgpt">finalizing (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#finalizing-chatgpt"></a></h2>
<p>This updated structure and terminology help align the concepts more clearly and introduce a cohesive way to handle versioning and dataset evolution:</p>
<h3 id="key-changes-and-their-implications"><strong>Key Changes and Their Implications</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#key-changes-and-their-implications"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>"Release" as the Command</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <strong>"release"</strong> as the command to evolve a DatasetSeries is effective. It clearly conveys that a dataset version is moving from a draft or "_next" state into a <strong>published, stable state</strong>. It fits naturally into the lifecycle terminology and suggests readiness for public consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Role of <code>vset</code> for Abstract Representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing a <strong><code>vset</code> folder</strong> to represent the <strong>DatasetFile in the abstract</strong> provides a useful separation between the conceptual dataset and its specific versions. This gives you a clear way to:
<ul>
<li>Reference the dataset conceptually without committing to a particular version.</li>
<li>Maintain consistency across versions by abstracting common metadata or relationships to the <code>vset</code> level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eliminating <code>_current</code> Folder</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By removing the <strong>_current folder</strong> and instead integrating <code>_catalog/_vset/v2/index.ttl</code> into the NamedIndividual's current distribution, you’re simplifying the representation.</li>
<li>This approach makes <strong><code>dave-richardson/index.trig</code></strong> a centralized place for accessing:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>default graph</strong> with pointers to the various components.</li>
<li>A <strong>catalog graph</strong>, where the <strong>graph name</strong> matches the latest <strong><code>vset</code></strong> catalog.</li>
<li>A <strong>default graph</strong> pointing to the latest dataset version, giving a comprehensive overview of the NamedIndividual's current state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Catalog and Dataset Representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having <strong>a catalog graph</strong> within the <strong>NamedIndividual's <code>index.trig</code></strong> is a smart way to keep everything in one accessible location, reducing redundancy and ensuring that the latest catalog version is always easy to find.</li>
<li>The <strong>default graph</strong> corresponding to the latest version of the dataset makes the data immediately accessible and up-to-date, aligning the namespace with the most current information without the need for additional layers like <code>_current</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="datasetfile-and-vset-relationship"><strong>DatasetFile and <code>vset</code> Relationship</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#datasetfile-and-vset-relationship"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It seems like <strong><code>vset</code></strong> could indeed serve the role that <strong>DatasetFile</strong> was intended to play, but perhaps with a more refined scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DatasetFile</strong> as previously conceptualized was a way to describe a dataset fully contained in a single file. </li>
<li><strong><code>vset</code></strong> is a logical extension of this—representing not only the dataset but also its versioning and relationship to the broader dataset series.</li>
<li>You could consider making <strong><code>vset</code> instances</strong> of type <strong><code>DatasetFile</code></strong>, implying that a <code>vset</code> instance is a specific manifestation of a DatasetFile that contributes to the versioned representation of the dataset series.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unified Concept or Distinction?</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <strong><code>vset</code></strong> and <strong>DatasetFile</strong> are to be unified, it would simplify the hierarchy, reducing the need to differentiate between different kinds of abstract dataset representations.</li>
<li>However, if there’s a need to distinguish between <strong>versioned</strong> (i.e., <code>vset</code>) and <strong>non-versioned, abstract</strong> DatasetFiles, you might keep them separate, where a <strong>DatasetFile</strong> is a more general concept and a <strong><code>vset</code></strong> is a specialized versioned instance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation-details-and-workflow"><strong>Implementation Details and Workflow</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#implementation-details-and-workflow"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Versioned Dataset Representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><code>vset</code></strong> approach gives you a centralized place for storing metadata and version-specific details.</li>
<li>Each <strong>release</strong> would generate a new folder within the <strong><code>vset</code></strong>, such as <code>_vset/v2/</code>, containing the dataset files (<code>index.ttl</code>) along with any distributions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Default Graphs and Catalog Graphs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>default graph</strong> in <code>dave-richardson/index.trig</code> serves as a cohesive entry point, providing context and links to:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>latest dataset version</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>latest catalog version</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Including <strong>catalog graphs</strong> directly within <code>index.trig</code> allows for efficient lookup and dereferencing by both humans and machines, keeping everything centralized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation Considerations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automating the <strong>"release" process</strong> could involve ensuring that:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>vset folder</strong> is updated.</li>
<li>The <strong>catalog graph</strong> in <code>index.trig</code> is appropriately updated to reflect the new release.</li>
<li><strong>Validation checks</strong> are performed before a release to make sure all named parts are unique and consistent across versions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publishing Workflow</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a dataset in <strong><code>_next</code></strong> is <strong>released</strong>, it becomes part of the <code>vset</code> and the <strong>namespace representation</strong> is updated accordingly:
<ul>
<li>Update the <strong>catalog graph</strong> within the <code>index.trig</code>.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>default graph</strong> to the latest version.</li>
<li>Optionally generate a <strong>changelog</strong> that summarizes what changed between versions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="next-steps"><strong>Next Steps</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#next-steps"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clarify DatasetFile vs. vset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine if it makes sense to collapse <strong>DatasetFile</strong> and <strong><code>vset</code></strong> into a single concept or if there are meaningful distinctions that justify keeping them separate. If <code>vset</code> works well as an evolution of DatasetFile, it may reduce complexity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implement the "Release" Command</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalize the <strong>"release" command</strong> to manage all aspects of evolving a dataset from <code>_next</code> to <code>_vset</code>. This command should:
<ul>
<li>Validate data integrity.</li>
<li>Update the appropriate parts of the <code>index.trig</code>.</li>
<li>Trigger necessary automations (like running the SSG if needed).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Update Documentation and Metadata Standards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that the <strong>documentation</strong> is updated to reflect the new role of <code>vset</code>, and ensure that all metadata standards accommodate the changes, including:
<ul>
<li>How catalogs reference <strong><code>vset</code></strong> instances.</li>
<li>How <strong>default and catalog graphs</strong> are structured to maintain consistency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach seems to be converging on a highly modular and organized system that captures versioning, publishing, and discovery in a coherent way. Let me know if you’d like further assistance with specifying these commands or refining the catalog and dataset structures!</p>

<p>Maybe "_default" isn't the right term, because it could be confused with "default graph." The vset IRI is a little confusing. It seems like it wouldn't reference an abstract dataset, but a versioned set of datasets. But it would be nice if you had a way to reference the abstract dataset, because the {NamedEntity}.trig file isn't it... Maybe the vset path could be the right thing, but it should have a better name than vset.</p>

<p>You've highlighted some critical distinctions that are worth clarifying to ensure your naming and paths are unambiguous and intuitive. Let's explore ways to address these concerns:</p>
<h3 id="revisiting-naming-and-conceptual-distinctions"><strong>Revisiting Naming and Conceptual Distinctions</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#revisiting-naming-and-conceptual-distinctions"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential Confusion with "_default"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using "_default" may indeed lead to confusion, especially with <strong>"default graph"</strong> terminology. It might be helpful to choose a term that implies the <strong>current or primary version</strong> but avoids the overlap with RDF’s default graph concept.</li>
<li>Consider alternatives like:
<ul>
<li><strong>"_primary"</strong>: Suggests the primary dataset series.</li>
<li><strong>"_latest"</strong>: Emphasizes that this is the most recent, stable series.</li>
<li><strong>"_main"</strong>: A common term that implies the main or standard dataset series without conflicting with RDF graph terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clarifying <code>vset</code> and Abstract Dataset Representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your observation that <strong><code>vset</code></strong> seems more like a reference to a <strong>versioned set of datasets</strong> rather than an <strong>abstract dataset</strong> is spot on. If it represents a series of versions, then the name should clearly convey that intent.</li>
<li>The <strong>abstract dataset</strong> is a conceptual entity—essentially the idea or definition of a dataset independent of specific versions or instances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Renaming <code>vset</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To better reflect the idea of a versioned set of datasets, you could consider:
<ul>
<li><strong>"_series"</strong>: A simple term that implies a collection of versions (e.g., <code>dave-richardson/series/</code>).</li>
<li><strong>"_versions"</strong>: Makes it explicit that it is a set of different versions.</li>
<li><strong>"_history"</strong>: If the emphasis is on chronological progression, implying a set of historical versions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, if you want something that implies it includes both the versions and a reference to the abstract dataset itself, then you might want something that blends both:
<ul>
<li><strong>"_canonical"</strong>: Could refer to the canonical definition and versions together, giving a sense of the abstract dataset and its realization.</li>
<li><strong>"_archive"</strong>: Implies a collection of all versions but could also include a reference to the canonical dataset itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Referencing the Abstract Dataset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be helpful to have a consistent way to reference the <strong>abstract dataset</strong>, distinct from the individual versions.</li>
<li>Consider having a <strong>dedicated IRI for the abstract dataset</strong>, which could be something like:
<ul>
<li><code>{namespace}/dave-richardson/dataset</code> — representing the dataset in an abstract sense, without tying it to any specific version.</li>
<li>This could coexist with a <strong><code>_series</code></strong> or <strong><code>_versions</code></strong> folder, which holds all specific versions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong><code>{NamedEntity}.trig</code></strong> file could then include pointers:
<ul>
<li>To the <strong>abstract dataset</strong> IRI.</li>
<li>To the <strong>current version</strong>.</li>
<li>To the <strong>catalog</strong> and other related resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="proposed-structure-example"><strong>Proposed Structure Example</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#proposed-structure-example"></a></h3>
<p>Consider organizing the dataset and version references as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstract Dataset Reference</strong>: <code>{namespace}/dave-richardson/dataset</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This serves as a stable IRI for the <strong>abstract concept</strong> of the dataset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dataset Series Path</strong> (formerly <code>vset</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>{namespace}/dave-richardson/series/</code></strong> or <strong><code>{namespace}/dave-richardson/versions/</code></strong></li>
<li>Contains all the different versions:
<ul>
<li><code>{namespace}/dave-richardson/series/v1/</code></li>
<li><code>{namespace}/dave-richardson/series/v2/</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This makes it clear that this path is a <strong>collection of versions</strong>, not the abstract dataset itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NamedIndividual Representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<p>You should be able to place a complete ontology file (a dataset file) in the data directory, and it mints the ontology IRI and all the ontology elements' IRIs in subfolders. In a sense the ontology IRI is a sub-namespace, but a very different thing from a SFNamespaceRepo. Would each of the ontology elements get their own _touchstone and _catalog series? I think we need to flesh out _catalog... does it lists other references, or only the serieses subsumed under the NamedIndividual in the hierarchy.</p>
<h2 id="ontology-use-case-chatgpt">ontology use case (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#ontology-use-case-chatgpt"></a></h2>
<p>These are some important questions, especially as you dive deeper into the intricacies of ontology management and versioning. Let's break down each aspect:</p>
<h3 id="ontology-iri-and-sub-namespace-considerations"><strong>Ontology IRI and Sub-Namespace Considerations</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#ontology-iri-and-sub-namespace-considerations"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ontology as a Sub-Namespace</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When placing a <strong>complete ontology file</strong> in the data directory, minting an <strong>ontology IRI</strong> and then each of the <strong>ontology elements</strong> into subfolders seems like a logical way to organize the ontology elements.</li>
<li>The <strong>ontology IRI</strong> serving as a <strong>sub-namespace</strong> is intuitive, as it allows you to logically group all the related elements. However, it differs significantly from a <strong>SFNamespaceRepo</strong>, which is broader and potentially integrates multiple ontologies, datasets, and more within a larger, centralized namespace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minting IRIs for Ontology Elements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <strong>ontology element</strong>—such as classes, properties, or individuals—could get its own <strong>IRI</strong> represented within subfolders, keeping the structure clear and consistent.</li>
<li>This would allow for greater granularity and modularity when managing ontology elements, which can be useful when evolving individual parts of the ontology over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="should-each-ontology-element-get-_touchstone-and-_catalog"><strong>Should Each Ontology Element Get <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code>?</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#should-each-ontology-element-get-_touchstone-and-_catalog"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>_touchstone for Ontology Elements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes sense to consider that <strong>each ontology element</strong> could have its own <code>_touchstone</code>. This would establish each element's <strong>authoritative version</strong>, allowing updates and changes to be handled in a systematic way.</li>
<li>For example, an ontology class might evolve independently from other classes, so having a <code>_touchstone</code> for each element provides a stable reference point and allows for independent versioning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>_catalog for Ontology Elements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The question of whether each element should get its own <code>_catalog</code> depends on the role you envision for <code>_catalog</code>. Here are two possible interpretations:
<ol>
<li><strong>If <code>_catalog</code> serves to list all available versions or related series</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Then each ontology element might also benefit from having its own <code>_catalog</code>. This would be particularly useful if you want to track and document all historical versions or variations of a specific element (e.g., a class evolving through multiple iterations).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>If <code>_catalog</code> only refers to subsumed series</strong>:
<ul>
<li>This could be more restrictive, in that the <code>_catalog</code> would list only the series <strong>directly under the hierarchy of the NamedIndividual</strong>. In that case, the ontology as a whole would have a <code>_catalog</code>, while individual elements might be tracked differently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="defining-_catalog-more-fully"><strong>Defining <code>_catalog</code> More Fully</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#defining-_catalog-more-fully"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Role of <code>_catalog</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>function of <code>_catalog</code></strong> should be clearly defined, depending on how much metadata and contextual information you need to store:
<ul>
<li><strong>Listing References</strong>: If <code>_catalog</code> should <strong>list other references</strong>, it could point to <strong>external ontologies, imported classes</strong>, or other relevant metadata. This would make it useful for ontology reuse and discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Subsumed Series</strong>: Alternatively, if <code>_catalog</code> is meant to <strong>list only the series under the NamedIndividual</strong>, it would serve as a kind of internal directory, strictly managing the elements that are part of the ontology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid Catalog Approach</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It might make sense to create a <strong>hybrid <code>_catalog</code></strong> that:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lists all series</strong> directly within the <strong>NamedIndividual's hierarchy</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Includes pointers</strong> to <strong>external references or linked ontologies</strong>. This could allow you to have a clear view of the ontology's internal evolution while also making it easy to understand its relationships with external sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This could look like:
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal Reference</strong>: List of <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_series</code> elements for ontology classes, properties, etc.</li>
<li><strong>External Links</strong>: Pointers to imported ontologies, external datasets, or other referenced ontological resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examples of What <code>_catalog</code> Could Include</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Versions and Series</strong> of ontology elements (<code>_touchstone</code>, <code>_series</code> paths).</li>
<li><strong>Imported Elements</strong> from other ontologies (<code>owl:imports</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Related NamedIndividuals</strong> that provide contextual links or dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Information</strong> that tracks changes and updates to the ontology elements over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="workflow-for-ontology-and-element-management"><strong>Workflow for Ontology and Element Management</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#workflow-for-ontology-and-element-management"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Placing Ontology File in Data Directory</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you place an ontology file in the <strong>data directory</strong>, the <strong>ontology IRI</strong> is minted, and the <strong>IRIs of ontology elements</strong> are automatically created based on the ontology's structure.</li>
<li>For each ontology element, a subfolder could be created, such as:
<pre><code>{namespace}/ontology/
  ├── ClassA/
  │   ├── _touchstone/
  │   └── _catalog/
  ├── PropertyB/
  │   ├── _touchstone/
  │   └── _catalog/
  └── IndividualC/
      ├── _touchstone/
      └── _catalog/
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing Versions and Evolution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <strong>element</strong> could evolve independently, meaning that <strong>_touchstone</strong> serves as the authoritative, evolving version of each element, while <strong>_catalog</strong> provides pointers to past versions or references.</li>
<li>When elements evolve, new versions would be added to their respective <strong>_series</strong> paths (or whatever naming convention you finalize).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation for Consistency</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>automated creation</strong> of IRIs, <code>_touchstone</code>, and <code>_catalog</code> for ontology elements can ensure consistency and reduce manual errors.</li>
<li><strong>Validation scripts</strong> could ensure that each new ontology file placed in the directory adheres to the expected structure, automatically creating the subfolders and IRIs needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="summary-1"><strong>Summary</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary-1"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>_touchstone</strong> works well for providing a <strong>stable, evolving reference</strong> for each ontology element.</li>
<li><strong>_catalog</strong> needs a clearer definition: it could list <strong>subsumed series</strong> and/or <strong>external references</strong>, depending on whether it serves as an <strong>internal directory</strong> or a broader <strong>contextual reference</strong>.</li>
<li>The process of placing a <strong>complete ontology</strong> into the data directory and minting IRIs for elements should create a structured approach where each element can evolve independently while being tied to the ontology as a whole.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="touchstone">touchstone<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#touchstone"></a></h2>
<p>I understand your concerns about <strong>"origin"</strong> potentially implying a one-time starting point that doesn’t evolve, which might mislead users regarding the nature of the dataset series. Let's explore <strong>"_touchstone"</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="touchstone-as-a-choice"><strong>Touchstone as a Choice</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#touchstone-as-a-choice"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>_touchstone</strong> has a very interesting connotation:
<ul>
<li>It suggests something that serves as a <strong>benchmark or standard</strong>—a reference against which other versions or instances are evaluated.</li>
<li>It conveys <strong>authority and reliability</strong>, which aligns with your idea of having a definitive version without implying it is static or incapable of evolving.</li>
<li>Historically, a <strong>touchstone</strong> was used to test the quality of gold or silver, which gives it a connotation of being the measure of <strong>authenticity</strong>—a fitting metaphor for a dataset that serves as the core reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pros-of-using-_touchstone"><strong>Pros of Using "_touchstone"</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pros-of-using-_touchstone"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Authority Without Stagnation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Unlike "origin," <strong>"touchstone"</strong> doesn’t imply that it’s the progenitor or a fixed starting point. Instead, it implies ongoing <strong>relevance and importance</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Benchmarking</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It implies that other versions might be <strong>compared to or evaluated against</strong> it, which makes sense for a dataset that evolves but remains the central reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Uniqueness</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The term <strong>"touchstone"</strong> is unique and memorable, which helps differentiate it from other terms like "main," "core," or "standard."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="considerations"><strong>Considerations</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#considerations"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abstract Nature</strong>: <strong>Touchstone</strong> is more abstract compared to terms like "standard" or "primary," so it may require some explanation when introduced to others, especially in a technical context. However, it has a memorable quality and conveys the right level of importance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#final-thoughts"></a></h3>
<p><strong>_touchstone</strong> seems like a strong candidate—it suggests both <strong>authority</strong> and <strong>continuity</strong> while avoiding implications of being static or unchanging, which is ideal for a dataset that will evolve but remain definitive. It gives a sense of something that all versions should relate to or be evaluated by, maintaining its role as the key reference point.</p>
<p>If you decide on <strong>_touchstone</strong>, it should convey the idea of being the core standard clearly, without the unintended connotations of "origin." Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to explore any other directions!</p>
<p>(and then)</p>
<p>Great choice! <strong>_touchstone</strong> definitely has a unique and memorable quality to it, standing out from the usual terminology. It gives your system a distinct identity and conveys authority without being too rigid or clichéd. If you need any further assistance integrating this into your framework or defining its role in detail, just let me know!</p>
<h2 id="_catalog-elaboration-dave">_catalog elaboration (dave)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#_catalog-elaboration-dave"></a></h2>
<p>I think _catalog should at least reference external vsets / series that the namespaced series might be a continuation of (or branch of). So at least some external references. </p>
<h2 id="_catalog-elaboration-chatgpt">_catalog elaboration (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#_catalog-elaboration-chatgpt"></a></h2>
<p>That makes perfect sense—having <code>_catalog</code> include <strong>external references</strong> like <code>vsets</code> or series that the current namespaced series builds upon or branches from helps to provide valuable <strong>context and provenance</strong>. This approach will allow you to represent <strong>lineage</strong>, making it clear how the current dataset or ontology <strong>connects to previous work</strong> or <strong>diverges from a parent</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="role-of-external-references-in-_catalog"><strong>Role of External References in <code>_catalog</code></strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#role-of-external-references-in-_catalog"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>External Continuations or Branches</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Referencing external series</strong> as part of <code>_catalog</code> establishes clear relationships, like which datasets or ontology elements the current series is derived from or is extending.</li>
<li>This can be incredibly valuable for understanding the <strong>evolutionary history</strong> of a dataset, especially when dealing with <strong>branches or forks</strong> from a common base.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provenance and Traceability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Including these references will enhance <strong>traceability</strong>, allowing users or tools to follow the evolution of data across namespaces.</li>
<li>It also gives a clear view of where a dataset <strong>originated</strong> and helps maintain a logical <strong>flow of authority</strong>, especially important when datasets or ontologies are used collaboratively or across different projects.</li>

<li>Linking to <strong>external <code>vsets</code> or series</strong> that are related by:

<li><strong>Continuation</strong>: If the current series is a direct continuation or update of an external series.</li>
<li><strong>Branching</strong>: If it diverges from another dataset or ontology but retains some shared lineage.</li>

<p>I've used "index.ttl" and "index.jsonld" in the vset versions, but those will be copies of the source "data" files, so maybe the name should be preserved. On the other hand, I didn't illustrate that every single folder (e.g., sflow-ontology/dss/_catalog/vset) will also have an index.html file, and probably index.ttl/index.json-ld files too, so you could argue that for consistency, the distributions should stay as index.ttl too... but I think I'm leaning towards making those leaf distribution filenames match the source.</p>

<p>You've raised an important point about maintaining <strong>consistency</strong> and preserving the <strong>integrity of the original data files</strong> while ensuring that your structure is navigable and intuitive. Let's break down the pros and cons of each approach and what might best serve your goals.</p>
<h3 id="option-1-preserve-original-filenames-for-leaf-distributions"><strong>Option 1: Preserve Original Filenames for Leaf Distributions</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#option-1-preserve-original-filenames-for-leaf-distributions"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Advantages of Preserving Filenames</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traceability</strong>: By preserving the <strong>original file names</strong> in the <strong>leaf distributions</strong> (<code>vset</code> folders), there is a <strong>clear, direct link</strong> between the source file in <code>data</code> and its representation in the <code>docs</code> structure.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Confusion</strong>: Users and collaborators working with the ontology or datasets will find it easier to identify the original file just by looking at the name in the distribution folder. For example, <code>sflow-ontology.ttl</code> appearing in <code>vset/v1/</code> is much more explicit about its origins than a generic <code>index.ttl</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Less Duplication Ambiguity</strong>: Maintaining unique filenames helps reduce potential confusion, especially if multiple versions or different ontologies end up in the same workspace (e.g., if someone downloads files locally).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workflow Clarity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <strong>automating workflows</strong> (e.g., updates from <code>data</code> to <code>docs</code>), it's easier to <strong>track changes</strong> in a source-to-distribution manner if filenames match.</li>
<li>This approach supports a <strong>more granular version control</strong> process since each specific dataset or ontology file is distinctly identifiable across different versions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example Structure with Preserved Filenames</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>- docs
  - sflow-ontology
    - _dss 
      - _touchstone
        - vset
          - v1
            - dist
              - sflow-ontology.ttl
              - sflow-ontology.jsonld
          - v2
            - dist
              - sflow-ontology.ttl
              - sflow-ontology.jsonld
  - dave-richardson
    - _dss 
      - _touchstone
        - vset
          - v1
            - dist
              - dave-richardson.jsonld
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Each <strong>distribution file</strong> retains the original name, preserving its identity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="option-2-use-indexttl-for-consistency-across-all-folders"><strong>Option 2: Use <code>index.ttl</code> for Consistency Across All Folders</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#option-2-use-indexttl-for-consistency-across-all-folders"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Advantages of Consistent Filenames</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uniformity</strong>: Every folder, regardless of what it represents, follows a <strong>consistent naming convention</strong> (<code>index.ttl</code>, <code>index.jsonld</code>). This makes it easy to <strong>know what to expect</strong> when navigating the structure, reducing ambiguity about which file to look for within a folder.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Navigation</strong>: If every folder has an <code>index.html</code> or <code>index.ttl</code>, it makes web-based discovery more consistent, especially when using a <strong>static site generator</strong>. The idea of default files (<code>index.*</code>) is commonly understood, which might make the SSG easier to configure.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Overhead in SSG</strong>: Using a consistent file naming convention means that <strong>templates and automation scripts</strong> don’t have to consider different filenames for different versions, which can simplify the configuration and setup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential Drawbacks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambiguity</strong> in Representation: The term "index" is <strong>generic</strong>, and without sufficient metadata, it might not be immediately clear which version or element the file refers to. This could lead to some confusion if users are dealing with multiple datasets.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Traceability</strong>: By not preserving the original filenames, the <strong>direct link</strong> between the source data (<code>data</code> folder) and its representation in the <code>docs</code> structure is less obvious, which could make tracking data provenance slightly harder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistency at the Cost of Clarity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If all <strong>leaf nodes</strong> are named <code>index.ttl</code>, you'll need a <strong>strong metadata strategy</strong> to identify and differentiate versions. This might include using metadata within the RDF itself to indicate the original source, version, or other unique identifiers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Considering your goal of providing clarity and <strong>avoiding redundancy</strong>, it seems that preserving the <strong>original filenames</strong> (e.g., <code>sflow-ontology.ttl</code>, <code>dave-richardson.jsonld</code>) within the <strong>leaf distribution folders</strong> is a good choice. Here are some reasons why this approach might work best:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear Provenance</strong>: The name itself acts as a form of metadata, making it easier to trace the <strong>source</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Less Manual Cross-Referencing</strong>: Users don’t need to rely on metadata or dig into RDF content to know which version or dataset they are looking at—the <strong>filename itself provides context</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity for Automation</strong>: While using consistent names like <code>index.*</code> might make some automation easier, preserving the original filename simplifies the <strong>mapping from source to version</strong>, which may make the update process more transparent and error-resistant.</li>
</ul>

<p>To strike a balance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>original filenames</strong> for the <strong>leaf distributions</strong> to preserve context and clarity.</li>
<li>Continue using <code>index.*</code> for <strong>navigation files</strong> within each folder (e.g., <code>index.html</code> for browsing or general context at the folder level).</li>
<li><strong>Metadata in Index Pages</strong>: Each folder's <code>index.html</code> could provide <strong>links to the preserved filenames</strong> within the <code>dist</code> directory, giving users an easy way to understand the context while keeping everything navigable.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Index Files for Navigation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Maintain <code>index.html</code>, <code>index.ttl</code>, and <code>index.jsonld</code> at higher levels (e.g., in each <code>vset</code> folder) to serve as <strong>navigational or summary points</strong>.</li>

<h2 id="current-iris-revisited-dave">current IRIs revisited (dave)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#current-iris-revisited-dave"></a></h2>
<p>One other thing to circle back to... the NamedIndividual's top-level index.trig was going to have a default graph with pointers to the catalog and touchstone, and named graphs with the contents of the current datasets for those two as well. But we don't have an IRI that corresponds to the current catalog or touchstone dataset. I like the idea of not bury the current in the dss/_catalog/vset folders, so maybe at the top level we could have sflow-ontology/_touchstone and sflow-ontology/_catalog ? I don't want to re-use sflow-ontology itself, because the referent is an ontology, not a "current version"</p>
<h2 id="current-iris-revisited-dave-1">current IRIs revisited (dave)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#current-iris-revisited-dave-1"></a></h2>
<p>I see your point—you need a <strong>distinct IRI</strong> that can cleanly and clearly represent the <strong>current versions</strong> without conflating it with the ontology itself. Here's a refined approach to help make the concept of <strong>current touchstone and catalog</strong> more explicit:</p>
<h3 id="proposed-structure-for-current-versions"><strong>Proposed Structure for Current Versions</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#proposed-structure-for-current-versions"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Top-Level Representation for Current Versions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rather than embedding the <strong>current versions</strong> deep within the <code>dss/_catalog/vset</code> folders, placing them at the <strong>top level</strong> makes them more <strong>discoverable</strong> and emphasizes their role as the <strong>authoritative, up-to-date references</strong>.</li>
<li>Using paths like:
<ul>
<li><code>sflow-ontology/_touchstone/</code></li>
<li><code>sflow-ontology/_catalog/</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These paths can represent the <strong>current state</strong> of the touchstone and catalog, respectively, without burying them within the version hierarchy. This helps make the most recent data more accessible, which aligns with the intent of representing a central, up-to-date version.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Top-Level Folder Names</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure would look something like this:
<pre><code>sflow-ontology/
  - _touchstone/
    - index.ttl
    - index.jsonld
  - _catalog/
    - index.ttl
    - index.jsonld
  - _dss/
    - _catalog/
      - vset/
        - v1/
          - dist/
            - index.ttl
            - index.jsonld
      - v2/
          - dist/
            - index.ttl
            - index.jsonld
    - _touchstone/
      - vset/
        - v1/
          - dist/
            - index.ttl
            - index.jsonld
        - v2/
          - dist/
            - index.ttl
            - index.jsonld
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clarifying the Role of Current Versions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>_touchstone</code></strong> and <strong><code>_catalog</code></strong> at the <strong>top level</strong> would serve as pointers to the <strong>most up-to-date version</strong>.</li>
<li>They contain the <strong>current dataset</strong> directly, and this <strong>IRI clearly differentiates</strong> between the concept of the ontology (<code>sflow-ontology</code>) and the current authoritative content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using <code>index.trig</code> for Centralized Access</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>top-level <code>index.trig</code></strong> for <code>sflow-ontology</code> could be structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>default graph</strong> pointing to both <code>_catalog</code> and <code>_touchstone</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Named graphs</strong> containing the contents of the current dataset from both <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This setup provides a <strong>centralized entry point</strong> for accessing the ontology, its current state, and the related catalog, making navigation and data discovery easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoiding Reuse of <code>sflow-ontology</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping the <strong><code>sflow-ontology</code></strong> IRI distinct ensures that it continues to represent the <strong>abstract concept of the ontology</strong> rather than a particular version or dataset.</li>
<li>The paths like <strong><code>_touchstone</code></strong> and <strong><code>_catalog</code></strong> directly under <code>sflow-ontology</code> allow you to avoid the ambiguity of reusing <code>sflow-ontology</code> for two different referents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="benefits-of-this-approach"><strong>Benefits of This Approach</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#benefits-of-this-approach"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By separating <strong>current versions</strong> into distinct <strong>top-level folders</strong>, you achieve a <strong>clear distinction</strong> between the ontology itself and the <strong>evolving datasets</strong> that represent the current state of the catalog and touchstone.</li>
<li>This keeps <strong>navigation intuitive</strong>—users know they can always go to the top-level <code>_touchstone</code> or <code>_catalog</code> to access the most recent, authoritative data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ease of Access</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Placing the current versions at the top level makes them <strong>immediately accessible</strong> without needing to navigate through potentially nested version structures.</li>
<li>This aligns well with the idea of having a centralized <code>index.trig</code> that points directly to these top-level folders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logical Consistency</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This approach avoids any overlap between the <strong>IRI for the ontology</strong> and the IRI for the <strong>current version</strong> of the datasets, maintaining <strong>semantic clarity</strong>.</li>
<li>It also respects the distinction between <strong>the ontology as a concept</strong> and its <strong>current dataset representation</strong>, making it easier to use and understand in practical applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="final-thoughts-1"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#final-thoughts-1"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Having <strong>top-level <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code></strong> makes it very clear what the most recent version is, and it avoids the semantic confusion of reusing <code>sflow-ontology</code> for a purpose it was not intended to serve.</li>
<li>This also simplifies version management, as the <strong>most up-to-date datasets</strong> are always kept at an easy-to-access location, while historical versions remain organized within their <code>vset</code> folders under <code>_dss</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure seems to strike the right balance between <strong>clarity, discoverability</strong>, and <strong>semantic rigor</strong>. Let me know if this aligns with your vision, or if you'd like to refine it further!</p>

<p>one issue with that is that _touchstone and _catalog are dataset series, so now they're being used to reference the current dataset. Not great. Maybe you don't even need to be able to reference the current version. As long as you can access the current version via the top-level index.trig</p>
<h2 id="trouble-with-repurposing-touchstone-and-catalog-chatgpt">trouble with repurposing touchstone and catalog (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#trouble-with-repurposing-touchstone-and-catalog-chatgpt"></a></h2>
<p>That's a very insightful point. You've identified a key distinction: <strong><code>_touchstone</code></strong> and <strong><code>_catalog</code></strong> are inherently <strong>dataset series</strong>, not individual datasets or versions. Using these series labels to represent the current version could indeed lead to confusion. Here's a refined approach to address this:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Rely on <code>index.trig</code> for Centralized Access</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of creating <strong>separate top-level folders</strong> for <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code> to represent the current versions, you could leverage the <strong>top-level <code>index.trig</code></strong> as the <strong>centralized entry point</strong> to provide access to:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>latest version</strong> of the <code>_touchstone</code> series.</li>
<li>The <strong>latest catalog</strong> without explicitly defining a new IRI for the current version.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Structure of <code>index.trig</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong><code>index.trig</code></strong> at the top level of <code>sflow-ontology</code> could have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>default graph</strong> with pointers to the <strong>current dataset series</strong> (<code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Named graphs</strong> that contain the <strong>contents</strong> of the <strong>current datasets</strong> from both <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code>. These named graphs could use the appropriate versioned IRI, but the key is that the data itself is accessible here without needing an explicit "current" label.</li>
</ul>

<p>This way, the <strong>current versions</strong> are represented through their <strong>latest named graphs</strong>, but there’s no explicit need to label them as "current." The <code>index.trig</code> acts as the navigator, providing access to the <strong>latest authoritative datasets</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why Removing Explicit "Current" References Works</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduces Ambiguity</strong>: By not assigning the current version to <code>_touchstone</code> or <code>_catalog</code> explicitly, you avoid any confusion about what those terms represent—they continue to stand for the <strong>entire dataset series</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Simplifies Version Management</strong>: This approach lets the <strong>dataset series (<code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code>) remain consistent</strong> as the evolving collections they are, while still making the <strong>current version accessible</strong> via the top-level entry point.</li>
<li><strong>No Need for Redundant IRIs</strong>: There’s no additional layer of IRIs for current versions, which helps avoid redundancy and reduces the complexity of your IRI space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing the Current Version via <code>index.trig</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top-Level Access</strong>: Consumers who need to access the <strong>most recent version</strong> of a dataset can do so directly through the <strong>top-level <code>index.trig</code></strong>, which will always point to the latest <code>vset</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>default graph</strong> can contain metadata and pointers to the <strong>current named graphs</strong>, while the named graphs themselves hold the <strong>current dataset content</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation and Workflow Considerations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever a new version of <strong><code>_touchstone</code></strong> or <strong><code>_catalog</code></strong> is created:
<ul>
<li>The <strong><code>index.trig</code></strong> is automatically updated to point to the <strong>newest <code>vset</code></strong>.</li>
<li>This ensures that consumers using the <code>index.trig</code> always access the <strong>latest authoritative content</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This process can be fully <strong>automated</strong>, making sure that there are no manual updates that could lead to inconsistencies between the versions and what is indicated in the entry point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="summary-2"><strong>Summary</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary-2"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid Explicit "Current" Labels</strong>: Instead of creating <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code> at the top level for current versions, use the <strong><code>index.trig</code></strong> as a central navigator that points to the most recent <code>vset</code> for both series.</li>
<li><strong>Preserve Semantic Clarity</strong>: <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code> remain clearly as <strong>dataset series</strong>, while <code>index.trig</code> handles the role of making the current version easily accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Simplify Version Management</strong>: This approach keeps your <strong>versioning structure simple</strong>, avoids redundant IRIs, and maintains clarity about the purpose of each series.</li>
</ul>
<p>By relying on <strong><code>index.trig</code></strong> for access to the latest versions, you maintain a clean structure that accurately reflects the nature of each element while making the <strong>current, authoritative datasets</strong> easily discoverable. This way, the focus remains on the <strong>dataset series</strong> evolving naturally, with the <code>index.trig</code> acting as a dynamic and consistent entry point.</p>

<p>It aligns, but I'm still uneasy about not having a way to refer to the current touchstone or catalog distinctly, or access them directly and individually.</p>
<p>regarding leaf/distribution node naming, we could additionally have index.ttl files that just point to the named distribution files.</p>

<p>I understand your concern—it makes sense to want a distinct way to <strong>refer to</strong> and <strong>access the current <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code></strong> datasets directly, especially if there are use cases where you need that straightforward reference.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Introduce "Current" Pointers at the Top-Level</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could introduce <strong>top-level IRIs</strong> specifically to point to the <strong>current version</strong> of <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code>. This way, you maintain a clear and distinct path for accessing these current datasets, while still keeping the logical separation intact.</li>
<li>For example:
<pre><code>sflow-ontology/
  - _current_touchstone/
    - index.ttl
    - index.jsonld
  - _current_catalog/
    - index.ttl
    - index.jsonld
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>These folders (e.g., <code>_current_touchstone</code>) are simply <strong>pointers</strong> to the current version of the <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code> series. This way, you can access the current dataset without confusion. Internally, these files could be generated and updated whenever a new version is created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Named Graphs in <code>index.trig</code> for Current Reference</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Another approach would be to maintain a <strong>named graph</strong> within the top-level <code>index.trig</code> that acts as a <strong>reference</strong> to the current version and can be dereferenced directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could give these graphs <strong>consistent, distinct IRIs</strong> like:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token url"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>https://namespace/sflow-ontology/_current_touchstone<span class="token punctuation">></span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token comment"># Contents or pointers to the current touchstone dataset</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token url"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>https://namespace/sflow-ontology/_current_catalog<span class="token punctuation">></span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token comment"># Contents or pointers to the current catalog dataset</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>This provides a <strong>specific IRI</strong> to point directly to the <strong>current version</strong>, while still allowing the <code>index.trig</code> to act as a centralized discovery point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Pointers Using RDF <code>owl:sameAs</code> or Custom Property</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside <strong><code>index.trig</code></strong>, you could create <strong>explicit pointers</strong> to identify the current version of <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code> using a standard like <strong><code>owl:sameAs</code></strong> or a custom property.</li>
<li>Example:
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">currentTouchstone</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">owl<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">sameAs</span></span> <span class="token url"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>https://namespace/sflow-ontology/_dss/_touchstone/vset/v2/<span class="token punctuation">></span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
<span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">currentCatalog</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">owl<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">sameAs</span></span> <span class="token url"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>https://namespace/sflow-ontology/_dss/_catalog/vset/v2/<span class="token punctuation">></span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Index Files as Pointers</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Adding <strong><code>index.ttl</code></strong> files in each leaf or distribution folder that <strong>point to the named files</strong> is a great idea to retain <strong>consistency</strong> while also preserving the <strong>original filenames</strong>.</li>
<li>These <code>index.ttl</code> files would essentially act as <strong>navigational aids</strong>:
<ul>
<li>They can contain RDF statements like <code>owl:sameAs</code> or similar to reference the <strong>distribution with its original name</strong>, ensuring a clear path for software and human users alike.</li>
<li>Example structure in a <code>vset</code> folder:
<pre><code>v1/
  - dist/
    - index.ttl  # Contains pointers to the specific distribution files.
    - sflow-ontology.ttl
    - sflow-ontology.jsonld
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>The <strong><code>index.ttl</code></strong> would include:

<h3 id="summary-3"><strong>Summary</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary-3"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top-Level Pointers for Current Versions</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Introducing <strong><code>_current_touchstone</code></strong> and <strong><code>_current_catalog</code></strong> folders at the top level of <code>sflow-ontology</code> would provide an unambiguous and direct reference to the <strong>current versions</strong>, without confusing them for a full dataset series.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Named Graphs for Current Reference</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>distinct IRIs</strong> within <code>index.trig</code> as <strong>named graphs</strong> to clearly identify the current version of each series.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Index.ttl as Navigational Pointers</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Adding <strong><code>index.ttl</code></strong> files in each distribution folder that point to the specific distribution files helps balance <strong>navigational consistency</strong> and <strong>original filename clarity</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These approaches should help alleviate the unease around not having a clear reference for the current version, while also ensuring that the structure remains intuitive and that <strong>discoverability</strong> is easy both programmatically and for users. Let me know if this feels more aligned with what you're aiming for or if you'd like to iterate further!</p>
<h2 id="eurekea-on-current-dave">eurekea on current (dave)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#eurekea-on-current-dave"></a></h2>
<p>Since the current are actually current dataset distributions, we could use the distribution convention to refer, e.g. sflow-ontology/sflow-ontology.ttl and sflow-ontology/sflow-ontology-catalog.ttl</p>
<h2 id="eurekea-on-current-chatgpt">eurekea on current (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#eurekea-on-current-chatgpt"></a></h2>
<p>That's a solid idea. Using the <strong>distribution naming convention</strong> to identify the current versions is both intuitive and consistent with the broader approach to RDF dataset management and versioning. This allows you to explicitly reference the current dataset distributions while keeping the semantics clear and avoiding the ambiguity we discussed before.</p>
<h3 id="revised-approach-for-current-dataset-distributions"><strong>Revised Approach for Current Dataset Distributions</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#revised-approach-for-current-dataset-distributions"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Naming Convention for Current Dataset Distributions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of having separate folders or introducing ambiguous top-level markers, you can directly place the <strong>current dataset distributions</strong> at the <strong>top level of the namespace</strong>, using the <strong>original filenames</strong>:
<pre><code>sflow-ontology/
  - sflow-ontology.ttl               # Current distribution of the main touchstone dataset
  - sflow-ontology.jsonld            # JSON-LD version of the current touchstone
  - sflow-ontology-catalog.ttl       # Current distribution for the catalog dataset
  - sflow-ontology-catalog.jsonld    # JSON-LD version for the current catalog
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>This approach is highly descriptive, as the filenames indicate both the <strong>entity</strong> and whether it is part of the <strong>touchstone</strong> or <strong>catalog</strong> dataset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advantages of This Approach</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semantic Clarity</strong>: The <strong>current versions</strong> are referred to using their <strong>actual names</strong> (<code>sflow-ontology.ttl</code>, <code>sflow-ontology-catalog.ttl</code>). This avoids confusion about what “current” represents since the filenames make it clear that these are the <strong>current distributions</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Reference</strong>: This structure allows for direct access to the <strong>latest versions</strong> without needing additional pointers, new IRIs, or complex navigation. The current versions are just <strong>directly accessible</strong> at a predictable path.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Version Management</strong>: When a new version is <strong>released</strong>, the <strong>current distribution files</strong> are simply <strong>updated or replaced</strong>, ensuring that the namespace always provides the most recent data at those top-level paths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How to Integrate With <code>index.trig</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>top-level <code>index.trig</code></strong> would still serve as the <strong>centralized access point</strong> for consumers. It would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a <strong>default graph</strong> containing metadata and pointers to the <strong>current catalog</strong> and <strong>touchstone</strong>.</li>
<li>Include <strong>named graphs</strong> representing the contents of the <strong>current datasets</strong> for both touchstone and catalog, with links pointing to these top-level distributions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example <code>index.trig</code>:</p>

</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>This maintains a <strong>direct and obvious link</strong> to the current version while ensuring that all access remains consistent through a top-level entry point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation Workflow for Updates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever a new <strong>version</strong> of <code>_touchstone</code> or <code>_catalog</code> is released:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>current distribution files</strong> (<code>sflow-ontology.ttl</code>, <code>sflow-ontology-catalog.ttl</code>) at the top level are <strong>updated or replaced</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong><code>index.trig</code></strong> is also updated to reflect any changes, maintaining consistency between what is linked as the "current version" and what is stored in the actual <code>vset</code> folders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leaf Distribution Files and Index Pointers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To maintain consistency, each <strong>leaf node</strong> (e.g., <code>vset</code> folders) could still have its <strong><code>index.ttl</code></strong> as a pointer to the named distribution files.</li>
<li>This means:
<ul>
<li>At the top level, the <strong>current versions</strong> are directly referred to by their names.</li>
<li>In <strong>version folders</strong> (e.g., <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code>), the <code>index.ttl</code> continues to <strong>point</strong> to the specific dataset files, ensuring that there is no ambiguity.</li>

<h2 id="including-version-in-filename">including version in filename<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#including-version-in-filename"></a></h2>
<p>Including the <strong>version</strong> in the <strong>filename</strong> has both advantages and disadvantages, depending on your specific goals and the type of workflows you want to support. Let's explore the <strong>pros and cons</strong> to help you determine if this approach aligns with your needs:</p>
<h3 id="pros-of-including-the-version-in-the-filename"><strong>Pros of Including the Version in the Filename</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pros-of-including-the-version-in-the-filename"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Clear Traceability and Provenance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit Version Identification</strong>: Including the version number directly in the filename (e.g., <code>sflow-ontology-v1.ttl</code>) provides an <strong>unambiguous indication</strong> of which version of the dataset you are dealing with.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Provenance Tracking</strong>: When files are downloaded, shared, or moved, having the version in the filename makes it much easier to track the <strong>provenance</strong> of a particular file. You can always tell what version a file represents, even if it's separated from its original context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced Ambiguity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instant Recognition</strong>: Users don’t need to check metadata or open the file to determine which version they are interacting with. The <strong>version number</strong> is right there in the filename, making it <strong>instantly recognizable</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Naming Conflicts</strong>: If different versions are placed in the same directory, using a <strong>versioned filename</strong> helps to <strong>avoid conflicts</strong>. Each file is unique, ensuring that different versions do not accidentally overwrite one another.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Facilitates Collaboration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distributed Collaboration</strong>: When working in a distributed environment (e.g., multiple contributors to a dataset), having <strong>explicit versioned filenames</strong> ensures that contributors can easily distinguish between files and versions, which reduces the likelihood of errors.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing and Reference</strong>: When files are shared across teams or externally, including the version helps others <strong>understand context</strong> without additional explanations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation and Scripting</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation-Friendly</strong>: If filenames include versions, automation scripts can work with <strong>naming conventions</strong> to easily determine and select specific versions for processing, archiving, or other operations.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Updates</strong>: Including versions in filenames makes it easy for scripts to iterate over versions, allowing for <strong>automated tracking</strong> of changes and history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Archival Clarity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit Archival Records</strong>: When storing or archiving datasets, having a version in the filename ensures that there’s no confusion about which version is being saved. This makes it easier to reconstruct the history of changes or updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cons-of-including-the-version-in-the-filename"><strong>Cons of Including the Version in the Filename</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cons-of-including-the-version-in-the-filename"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential Redundancy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overlapping Metadata</strong>: The version number is likely already included as <strong>metadata within the file</strong> itself or in the dataset IRI. Including it in the filename could be seen as redundant, especially if the versioning is consistently handled at other layers.</li>
<li><strong>Too Much Information in the Name</strong>: Filenames can get <strong>long and unwieldy</strong> if they also contain descriptive information alongside the version, which might make navigation less tidy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Challenging Updates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Re-naming Complexity</strong>: If a dataset evolves and becomes a new version, the filename must be updated to reflect that change (e.g., from <code>-v1</code> to <code>-v2</code>). This can introduce <strong>complexity in workflows</strong>, as downstream references to the filename might also need to be updated.</li>
<li><strong>Broken Links</strong>: If other systems, applications, or scripts reference a specific file by its name, updating the filename to include a new version could result in <strong>broken links or references</strong>. This might require additional effort to track and update references whenever the version changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Human Error Risk</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual Naming Errors</strong>: If filenames are updated manually, there’s a risk of <strong>human error</strong>—such as forgetting to update the version number or using an incorrect version label. This could lead to confusion about which version is authoritative.</li>
<li><strong>Misleading Names</strong>: A filename might indicate a particular version, but if the content isn’t correctly synchronized, the <strong>filename could be misleading</strong>. This can happen when copies are made without careful updating of version labels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File Navigation Complexity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overwhelming for Users</strong>: For non-technical users, seeing many files with versions (e.g., <code>-v1</code>, <code>-v2</code>, etc.) might be overwhelming. This is particularly the case if <strong>numerous versions</strong> exist, making it harder for a user to determine which file to use without additional guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Clutter in Directories</strong>: When directories have multiple files representing different versions of the same dataset, it can create a <strong>cluttered folder structure</strong>, which might be difficult to navigate for users unfamiliar with the naming convention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Storage and Management Issues</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple Copies of Files</strong>: Since each version gets a separate filename, this can lead to multiple <strong>independent copies</strong> of datasets within a file system, rather than maintaining a central dataset with version history. This could increase <strong>storage needs</strong> and make it harder to consolidate changes.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization Issues</strong>: In systems where version control is handled by tools like <strong>Git</strong>, including the version in the filename may cause unnecessary complexity with synchronization, especially if multiple versions are being tracked independently rather than through the versioning system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="balancing-the-pros-and-cons"><strong>Balancing the Pros and Cons</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#balancing-the-pros-and-cons"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include Version in Filename for Historical or Distribution Purposes</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If you need to <strong>distribute datasets</strong> or <strong>archive historical versions</strong>, it makes sense to include the version number in the filename. This aids in clarity, traceability, and reduces ambiguity for end users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Use Separate Metadata for Internal or Systematic Versioning</strong>:
<ul>
<li>For internal management, where versioning is handled through <strong>dataset IRIs</strong> or <strong>metadata</strong> (such as <code>index.trig</code> or linked data properties), you could <strong>avoid including the version</strong> in the filename and rely on these structured methods to convey version information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Approach for Consistency</strong>:
<ul>
<li>You could maintain <strong>consistent filenames</strong> (e.g., <code>sflow-ontology.ttl</code> for current versions) at the <strong>top level</strong>, while having <strong>version-specific filenames</strong> (<code>sflow-ontology-v1.ttl</code>) in the <strong><code>vset</code> folders</strong>. This provides easy access to the latest version while also retaining a clear versioned history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary-5"><strong>Summary</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary-5"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: Including the version in filenames provides <strong>traceability</strong>, <strong>clarity</strong>, and makes it easier to collaborate and automate processes.</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: It introduces the risk of <strong>redundancy</strong>, <strong>human error</strong>, and <strong>complex navigation</strong>, especially in cases of manual handling or large numbers of versions.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation</strong>: A <strong>hybrid approach</strong> may be the best of both worlds—use consistent filenames for the <strong>current authoritative version</strong> while incorporating version-specific names for archived versions to aid in historical tracking and distribution. This allows for direct access to the latest dataset, while ensuring that older versions are clearly marked and accessible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="monstrosity-dave">monstrosity (dave)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#monstrosity-dave"></a></h2>
<p>It becomes kinda monstrous, especially with repeating the dss and current files for every namedindividual. maybe unless the NIs have their own data file in the data directory, their output subfolder just gets index.html and an index.trig/jsonld pointing to the defining dss and its catalog</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on Centralized Data</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For NamedIndividuals that <strong>don’t have their own dedicated data file</strong> in the <code>data</code> directory, there’s no need to create <strong>repetitive <code>_dss</code> or versioned dataset series</strong> for each of them.</li>
<li>Instead, they can simply <strong>reference</strong> the relevant dataset series that are already defined in the more central or general ontology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Output Subfolder with Minimal Files</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The output subfolder for each such NamedIndividual would only contain the following files:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>index.html</code></strong>: Provides a <strong>human-readable view</strong> of the NamedIndividual, summarizing the key information and relationships.</li>
<li><strong><code>index.trig</code> and <code>index.jsonld</code></strong>: These files serve as machine-readable formats that <strong>reference the defining <code>_dss</code> and <code>_catalog</code></strong> series.
<ul>
<li>The <strong><code>index.trig</code></strong> can include named graphs that simply <strong>link back</strong> to the primary <code>_dss</code> or <code>_catalog</code>, ensuring all references are centralized.</li>
<li>This means that instead of creating redundant copies of the full dataset, the <code>index.trig</code> simply has references like:
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">default</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Benefits of This Approach</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced Redundancy</strong>: By avoiding duplicate dataset series and distribution files, the <strong>complexity</strong> of the file structure is significantly reduced, especially for <strong>large ontologies</strong> with numerous NamedIndividuals.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Maintenance</strong>: You avoid the hassle of <strong>updating multiple versions</strong> whenever there are changes in the <code>_touchstone</code> or <code>_catalog</code>. All NamedIndividuals simply point to the centrally maintained versions.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Clarity</strong>: The purpose of each NamedIndividual’s subfolder is more focused on <strong>linking and referencing</strong> rather than storing duplicated data, which makes the repository structure easier to understand and navigate.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>Proposed Example Structure Update</strong>:</p>
<ul>

</code></pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Docs Folder</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>NamedIndividuals</strong> that do not have their own data file would have a much <strong>simpler folder structure</strong>:

<p><strong>Clarifying Relationships</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><code>index.html</code></strong> for each NamedIndividual could still be generated from a <strong>template</strong>, giving a summary of what that NamedIndividual represents and its relationship to the <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code> series.</li>
<li>This HTML file acts as the <strong>human-readable front-end</strong>, while <code>index.trig</code> and <code>index.jsonld</code> provide the <strong>machine-readable metadata</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="implementation-considerations"><strong>Implementation Considerations</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#implementation-considerations"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation Tools</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Updating and generating <strong><code>index.trig</code></strong> files that reference the appropriate <strong>_dss</strong> can be managed through automation. Scripts can scan the <strong>data folder</strong> to determine if a NamedIndividual has its own dataset, and then generate appropriate output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unique IRIs</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Since these <code>index.trig</code> files are <strong>pointing to a centralized dataset series</strong>, ensure that each NamedIndividual has a <strong>unique IRI</strong> that still distinguishes it within the namespace, even though the data source is shared.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary-6"><strong>Summary</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary-6"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>For NamedIndividuals <strong>without their own data files</strong>, you can significantly reduce redundancy by <strong>omitting full <code>_dss</code> series</strong> and instead including only:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>index.html</code></strong> for human-readable summaries.</li>
<li><strong><code>index.trig</code> and <code>index.jsonld</code></strong> that link to the <strong>defining <code>_touchstone</code> and <code>_catalog</code></strong> series.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This approach keeps the structure <strong>leaner</strong> while maintaining all the necessary <strong>semantic connections</strong> between NamedIndividuals and their relevant datasets.</li>
<li>The repository becomes much easier to <strong>maintain and navigate</strong>, especially when dealing with a large number of NamedIndividuals, each of which can now be handled by simple referencing rather than duplicative content.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should help make the system much more manageable without sacrificing functionality or clarity. Let me know if this works for you or if you need more refinement on how to automate or template these changes!</p>
