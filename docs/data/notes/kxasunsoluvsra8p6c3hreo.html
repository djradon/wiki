<p>The goal of OntoPop is to democratize ontologies by making them easier to understand and more accessible to a broader range of users beyond information and data architects. By democratizing ontologies, OntoPop enables organisations and individuals to easily visualise, explore and semantically query their knowledge assets, data and relationships. </p>

<h3 id="interoperability">Interoperability<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#interoperability"></a></h3>
<p>Every OntoPop service is developed using open standards and open frameworks and, as such, is agnostic of the target deployment environment meaning that OntoPop supports deployment to on-premise, private cloud, public cloud (including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform), multi-cloud and/or hybrid environments, and supports integration with industry-standard middleware and other open software services.</p>
<h3 id="reusability">Reusability<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#reusability"></a></h3>
<p>Given that OntoPop is a collection of event-driven services, each service may be reused beyond the specific purposes of ontology visualisation, search, exploration and management. For example, the OntoPop property graph services may be reused to load, manage and query general graph databases for a wide range of alternative use cases including fraud detection, digital twins, disease modelling, behavioural analysis, recommendation systems and natural language processing.</p>
