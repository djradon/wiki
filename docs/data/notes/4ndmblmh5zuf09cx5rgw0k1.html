<p>Good evening from <a href="/wiki/notes/3mgnxtge7uoc2mj3u564tgf">the ol' Magic Store</a>: Los Angeles, California. I'm a creative technologist and a role-player, and I'm on a mission to help people build, deconstruct, remix, and engage with the multiverse, leaving good stories in the wake.</p>
<h2 id="whats-this-all-about-then">What's This All About, Then?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#whats-this-all-about-then"></a></h2>
<p><em>Carpe Noctem</em> (loosely translated as "harvest the night") will be a series of notes, letters, and articles about <a href="/wiki/notes/6asj3x3t8lolgk0qq1h2jw9">collaborative storytelling</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/8vbo538h0rfcm6dyuqrxbxb">game studies</a>, and <a href="/wiki/notes/vdligrphd3nnqieslle2hhf">computer-assisted role-playing (CARP)</a>.</p>
<p>You can think of CARP as digital Dungeons &#x26; Dragons, but any setting will work. Alien space horror, cyberpunk dystopia, and supernatural gothic are some of the more popular flavors. But also, and more practically: psychotherapy, job training, and language learning.</p>
<p>Closely-related art forms are <a href="/wiki/notes/ivd6r43ip3pvorcrl7w89jy">interactive storytelling</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/x27pobn88jv8gp8h3l36hn5">interactive drama</a> and <a href="/wiki/notes/0isdkx5l3u5m5ykuenmx6o9">interactive fiction</a>. </p>
<p>When done well, improvisational and social role-playing (in whatever form) become <a href="/wiki/notes/6asj3x3t8lolgk0qq1h2jw9">collaborative storytelling</a>. </p>
<p>Half the dream, and maybe it's a <a href="/wiki/notes/b1h0j78mhw4zmcvqtc8yr1f">pipe-dream</a>, is that you can mix collaboration, player choice (i.e., an open-ish world), role-playing, and the principles of good gaming, and somehow get a great story out of it. </p>
<p>The other half of the dream is making the creation and enjoyment of these collaborative, interactive, role-playing experiences accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>So I want to explore prior art, theory, and the latest innovations around how computers can connect, entertain, and empower us <a href="/wiki/notes/npjtp7zcb0gj8tv80xhv1ux">without sucking out the creativity, imagination, and fun</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, this new medium looks and plays a lot like drama club meets primitive video games. Which is great. Beautiful, even! I hope we'll always have "retro-carp" as an option.</p>
<p>But role-playing and other forms of interactive drama will continue to get more accessible, inclusive, create-able, and re-mixable. And there's certainly potential for much more elaborate and cinematic experiences if that appeals.</p>
<p>It's going to be wild!</p>

<p><em>Carpe Noctem</em> will also touch on conceptual modeling, i.e., how to think about and structure information and ideas. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/notes/ly8z6maiioqzaj4awcm2e3c">Applied ontology</a> involves the investigation of the nature of various domains of interest (like fiction or role-playing) and the cognitive and linguistic constructs we use to understand them.</p>
<p>[Aside to my dad: Feels good to be back in construction after all these years!]</p>
<p>So how do we express these constructs digitally? One approach involves a controversial data-modeling technology called <a href="/wiki/notes/cQHSPbwz5JLE40UxftY7w">RDF</a>. We'll talk more about it in an upcoming post.</p>
<p>Intellectually and practically speaking, conceptual modelling is a gold mine. Two rich veins concern the modelling of time and space, and how to model change. If you're not even remotely interested in how to represent imaginary, evolving spatio-temporal entities, don't worry... you will be! </p>
<h3 id="other-topics">Other Topics<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#other-topics"></a></h3>
<p>I also intend to take little bites of philosophy, psychology, literary theory, and library science. So things like <a href="/wiki/notes/5z50816zi5s0f3gyt6ljuos">narratology</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/pjoi4nys1213nuh8awwuuph">theories of creativity</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/notes/r7l8yao8gmrka8hachs5kjh">philosophy of fictional entities</a>. (Spoiler alert: They're all real.)</p>

<p><img src="/wiki/assets/images/2024-09-13-16-43-26.png"></p>
<p>Eight quick years ago I was blessed to get in on the ground floor of a four-player, geographically-distributed Dungeons &#x26; Dragons campaign. </p>
<p>Even if you've never tried it, you probably know that classic "pen and paper" D&#x26;D involves folks role-playing characters in a fantasy setting, figuring out what those characters should try to do, and rolling dice to add an element of chance to their imaginary efforts. </p>
<p>Our campaign uses a <a href="/wiki/notes/bKzmyGQZRf8Z7VcQ3gg9m">virtual tabletop</a> called <a href="/wiki/notes/NIS3Dr1wSAOECAjgT8l6Y">Roll20</a>, was set in the <a href="/wiki/notes/8jtt0se7jzfe53y6cjzcoku">Forgotten Realms</a>, and was based on a well-known adventure module called <a href="/wiki/notes/nvybdysewvuvur5f2z1oa1e">Storm Kings Thunder</a>. </p>
<p>(For those who aren't familiar, the Forgotten Realms is without doubt one of the richest fictional worlds ever elaborated, with its own detailed <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Geography">geography</a>, <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Settlements">hundred of settlements</a>, <a href="https://screenrant.com/dungeons-dragons-deities-gods-forgotten-realms-fifth-edition/">dozens of deities</a>, and a truly <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:History">fantastical history</a>. The fan base is huge, so in addition to over 300 "official" published novels, close to 100 different role-playing adventure modules, and a pretty decent <a href="/wiki/notes/64zky57txokuxe8bxqx2ju1">movie</a>, there are countless works of homebrew content and fan fiction.)</p>
<p>In the hands of our highly-capable <a href="/wiki/notes/1p0hitgrhj81k4xku9iyzb1">Game Master (GM)</a>, the campaign transcended even the vastness of the Realms, and became a bespoke, time-travelling, genre-bending, setting-spanning epic. </p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge for us hapless players was keeping track of all the places, characters, factions, plotlines, and quests. </p>
<p>So I started an "as-we-played" written narrative, frantically transcribing memorable dialog, summarizing battles, and generally documenting our adventures from the perspective of my character, an axe-wielding barbarian. After our sessions, I would email these summaries to my eager and grateful crew. </p>
<p>It was a great opportunity to flex my writing skills.</p>
<p>It also allowed me to experiment with different narrative styles and forms. My summaries evolved from a lengthy Google Doc into an interlinked wiki where I've been trying to encode the relationships between characters, places, items, locations, and achievements. It was essentially a semantic web: a textual network of inter-linked concepts, entities, and happenings.</p>
<p>And it helped me realize that role-playing gaming and story-telling in general could benefit from some good conceptual modeling.</p>
<h2 id="whither-the-semantic-web">Whither the Semantic Web?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#whither-the-semantic-web"></a></h2>
<p>My original project to keep track of our role-playing adventures has exploded and seeped into countless gopher holes, including a big one known as the <a href="/wiki/notes/178ZuAuS3pVbx4PGWgAWj">Semantic Web</a>. With a capital 'S' and a capital 'W'.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>To borrow from <a href="/wiki/notes/9nekcruzel3yc9hgo7hqhbi">Gavin Mendel-Gleason</a>, the vision of the Semantic Web is distributed, interoperable, and well-defined data. It's a solution, in his words, to "literally the most central problem for the current and near-future human economy," i.e., how to make our data, knowledge and ideas accessible and understandable to each other and our computers.</p>
<p>The Semantic Web has had its best success in the field of <a href="/wiki/notes/tp5friqhwq5hwuby48hjl3z">bioinformatics</a>. It's also used in <a href="/wiki/notes/jabfpg3pk1nieaxogfirhit">library science</a>, healthcare, financial services, and e-commerce.</p>
<p>But despite being around for 25 years, the Semantic Web hasn't caught on widely or lived up to its potential. We can explore some of the reasons later, but in my opinion, it's a technology in need of a killer app.</p>
<h2 id="can-role-playing-save-the-semantic-web">Can Role-Playing Save the Semantic Web?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#can-role-playing-save-the-semantic-web"></a></h2>
<p>Practically speaking, people and their software could use good conceptualizations and shared knowledge to keep track of what happens in games and stories of all kinds, in a way that other people and computers can understand. </p>
<p>But beyond this documentary function, the conceptualizations I'm talking about could be used by writers, creators and <a href="/wiki/notes/1p0hitgrhj81k4xku9iyzb1">Game Masters</a> to help create scenarios, worlds, and systems of their own that could be easily shared, adapted, and remixed. </p>
<p>It's the "distributed, interoperable, and well-defined" vision of the Semantic Web applied to the realm of imagination. To supercharge CARP, people will need a way to share their stories and their creations.</p>
<p>Role-playing software and game engines based on open conceptualizations and Semantic Web technologies could empower people to connect, play, create, and collaborate together, in meat-space and online, in ways we can only dream about.</p>
<p>And as a side-effect, I think the innovations and momentum these role-playing applications would generate for Semantic Web technologies could bring its promise to life for other domains as well.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-virtual-reality-suck">Why does virtual reality suck?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-does-virtual-reality-suck"></a></h2>
<p>In the words of <a href="/wiki/notes/r5y3bpskszo7gva6cj4kirp">Ian Bogost</a>, "3-D worlds seem more and more real. But those worlds feel even more incongruous when the [synthetic] people that inhabit them behave like animatronics and the environments work like Potemkin villages." </p>
<p>Traditional role-playing doesn't have this problem because a good writer <em>authors</em> good characters, places, and situations, and then a good GM and the players' imaginations <em>bring them to life</em>. </p>
<p>Maybe virtual reality and modern RPGs leave too little to the imagination? </p>
<p>But certainly, virtual reality currently lacks some essential elements of D&#x26;D as originally conceived: the crafting of interesting scenarios, the simplicity of pen-and-paper, the ease with which you can transcend the system, and the benevolent shepherding of a human behind the curtain.</p>
<p>With D&#x26;D, GMs can easily make anything happen, answer out-of-game questions, adjust the pace, call for a snack break, keep things interesting, and fill in gaps with a little improv and some <a href="/wiki/notes/vwyhrp1gd7xkitf3qgcej36">Theater of the Mind</a>. They run the magic store. </p>
<p>Virtual reality needs something like that.</p>
<h2 id="will-ai-ruin-the-fun">Will AI Ruin the Fun?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#will-ai-ruin-the-fun"></a></h2>
<p>With the recent dramatic improvements in generative AI, we can foresee more realistic synthetic dialogue in virtual reality and video games. We can foresee less-dismaying and less-sterile synthetic artwork. And it's not too hard to imagine a near future where new innovations will support the generation of synthetic-yet-coherent characters, puzzles, worlds, stories, and experiences. </p>
<p>But do we want that? </p>
<p>There's a very tricky tension between getting digital assistance and preserving the joy and humanity we find in the DIY crafting of traditional games and narrative. You can expect that to be one of <em>Carpe Noctem</em>'s recurring themes.</p>

<p>My intended audience here is a general one: people who might be interested in story-telling, role-playing, video games, virtual reality, creativity, AI, and a bit of philosophy. </p>

<h2 id="postscript-why-carpe-noctem">Postscript: Why <em>Carpe Noctem</em>?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#postscript-why-carpe-noctem"></a></h2>
<p>At least since <a href="/wiki/notes/mmtujkakfvlae6pwekczfc6">Dead Poets Society</a>, the Latin phrase <em><a href="/wiki/notes/2sxpnftl25g1vk4nt3guj6i">Carpe Diem</a></em> has come to mean "seize the day." Essentially, grab life by the horns. </p>
<p>As <a href="/wiki/notes/gfsrtlv94ywathmphykh47s">Jack Shepherd</a> beautifully explores in <a href="https://medium.com/the-cellar-door/carpe-diem-doesnt-mean-seize-the-day-770fbf63a820">“Carpe Diem” Doesn’t Mean “Seize the Day”</a>, a more accurate translation is "pluck the day." It's a horticultural metaphor about gathering or harvesting the fruits of life.</p>
<p>But what about the night? </p>
<p>Like most entertainment, role-playing gaming is often fitted in after work hours. Typical sessions last three to five hours and often stretch past midnight. All-nighters are glamorized legend-fodder. Pluck those zombies, harvest the magic items, and seize the stronghold before the sun comes up!</p>
<p>Writing too has its nocturnal mystique. <a href="/wiki/notes/aollktezkvx0z0bxejrbr9g">James Baldwin</a> wrote in <a href="/wiki/notes/njp9yjeexmhuimj3al6yoi5">Nothing Personal</a> about how the grim realizations of 4am (a "devastating hour"), could in turn be a source of strength. <a href="/wiki/notes/g2gp99n23xwfmcsgt61ax0w">Kafka</a> wrote ruefully of sleep: "Just think how many thoughts a blanket smothers while one lies alone in bed." Proust, Plath, Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot and George Sand are among the many writers famed to do their best work at night. </p>
<p>Regardless of quality, as the father of a wakeful two year old, <a href="/wiki/notes/aupqq2yswtykk0z003zk5sj">night time is often write time</a> for me.</p>
