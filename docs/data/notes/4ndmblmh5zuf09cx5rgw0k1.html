<p>Good evening from the ol' <a href="/wiki/notes/3vo58d0zyt05elqcfuli1zz">Magic Store</a>: Los Angeles, California. My name is Dave Richardson and I think I know how to make virtual reality actually worthwhile while revolutionizing how we make and share information at the same time.</p>
<p>How? </p>
<p>I'll give you a hint: collaborative story-telling.</p>

<p>Aspirationally speaking, <em>Carpe Noctem</em> (loosely translated as "harvest the night") will be a series of articles about <a href="/wiki/notes/vdligrphd3nnqieslle2hhf">computer-assisted role-playing</a>.</p>
<p>You can think of it as digital Dungeons &#x26; Dragons, but any setting will work. Alien space horror, cyberpunk dystopia, and supernatural gothic are some of the more popular flavors. But also, and more practically: psychotherapy, job training, and language learning.</p>
<p>Two closely-related art forms are <a href="/wiki/notes/x27pobn88jv8gp8h3l36hn5">Interactive Drama</a> and <a href="/wiki/notes/0isdkx5l3u5m5ykuenmx6o9">interactive fiction</a>. Hopefully we'll be covering those.</p>
<p>And when done well, role-playing (in whatever form) becomes <a href="/wiki/notes/6asj3x3t8lolgk0qq1h2jw9">collaborative story-telling</a>. So that's a biggie.</p>
<p>I also intend to cover little nibbles of philosophy, psychology, literary theory, and library science. So things like <a href="/wiki/notes/5z50816zi5s0f3gyt6ljuos">narratology</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/pjoi4nys1213nuh8awwuuph">theories of creativity</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/notes/r7l8yao8gmrka8hachs5kjh">philosophy of fictional entities</a>. </p>
<p>Spoiler alert: Batman is real.</p>

<p><em>Carpe Noctem</em> will also touch on conceptual modeling, i.e., how to think about and structure knowledge and ideas. </p>
<p>There's a field called <a href="/wiki/notes/ly8z6maiioqzaj4awcm2e3c">applied ontology</a> that I'm trying to break into. It involves the investigation of the nature of various domains of interest (like fiction or role-playing) and the cognitive and linguistic constructs we use to understand them.</p>
<p>[Aside to my dad: Feels good to be back in construction after all these years!]</p>
<p>So how do we express these constructs digitally? One approach involves a controversial data-modeling technology called <a href="/wiki/notes/cQHSPbwz5JLE40UxftY7w">RDF</a>. We'll talk about it more in an upcoming post.</p>
<p>Intellectually speaking, conceptual modelling is a gold mine. One rich vein concerns the modelling of time and space, and how to model change. If you're not even remotely interested in how to represent imaginary spatio-temporal entities, don't worry... you will be! </p>

<p>Eight quick years ago I was blessed to get in on the ground floor of a Dungeons &#x26; Dragons campaign. Even if you've never tried it, you probably know it involves folks role-playing characters in a fantasy setting, figuring out what those characters should try to do, and rolling dice to add an element of chance to their imaginary efforts. </p>
<p>Our scenario was based on pre-built module called <a href="/wiki/notes/nvybdysewvuvur5f2z1oa1e">Storm Kings Thunder</a> and initially set in the <a href="/wiki/notes/8jtt0se7jzfe53y6cjzcoku">Forgotten Realms</a>. </p>
<p>The Forgotten Realms is without doubt one of the richest fictional worlds ever created, with its own geography, societies, pantheon, incredibly elaborate history, a huge fan base. </p>
<p>But in the hands of our highly-capable <a href="/wiki/notes/1p0hitgrhj81k4xku9iyzb1">Game Master</a>, the campaign became a bespoke, time-travelling, genre-bending, setting-spanning epic. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge for us hapless players was keeping track of all the places, characters, factions, plotlines, and quests. </p>
<p>So I started an "as-we-played" written narrative, frantically transcribing memorable dialog, summarizing battles, and generally documenting our adventures from the perspective of my character, an axe-wielding barbarian. After our sessions, I would email these summaries to my eager and grateful crew. </p>
<p>It was a great opportunity to flex my writing skills.</p>
<p>It has also allowed me to experiment with different narrative styles and forms. My summaries evolved from a lengthy Google Doc into an interlinked wiki, where I've been encoding the relationships between characters, places, items, locations, and achievements as one big graph. It was essentially a semantic web: a textual network of inter-linked concepts, entities, and happenings.</p>
<p>And it helped me realize that role-playing gaming and story-telling in general could benefit from some good conceptual modeling.</p>
<h2 id="whither-the-semantic-web">Whither the Semantic Web?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#whither-the-semantic-web"></a></h2>
<p>My original project to keep track of our role-playing adventures has exploded and seeped into countless gopher holes, including a big one known as the <a href="/wiki/notes/178ZuAuS3pVbx4PGWgAWj">Semantic Web</a>. With a capital 'S' and a capital 'W'.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>To borrow from <a href="/wiki/notes/9nekcruzel3yc9hgo7hqhbi">Gavin Mendel-Gleason</a>, the vision of the Semantic Web is distributed, interoperable, and well-defined data. It's a solution, in his words, to "literally the most central problem for the current and near-future human economy," i.e., how to make our data, knowledge and ideas accessible and understandable to each other and our computers.</p>
<p>The Semantic Web has had the most success in the field of <a href="/wiki/notes/tp5friqhwq5hwuby48hjl3z">bioinformatics</a>. It's also used in <a href="/wiki/notes/jabfpg3pk1nieaxogfirhit">library science</a>, healthcare, financial services, and e-commerce.</p>
<p>But despite being around for 25 years, the Semantic Web hasn't caught on widely or lived up to its potential. We can explore some of the reasons later, but in my opinion, it's a technology in need of a killer app.</p>
<h2 id="can-role-playing-save-the-semantic-web">Can Role-Playing Save the Semantic Web?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#can-role-playing-save-the-semantic-web"></a></h2>
<p>Practically speaking, people and their software could use good conceptualizations and shared knowledge to keep track of what happens in games and stories of all kinds, and in a way that other people and computers can understand. </p>
<p>But beyond this documentary function, the constructs I'm talking about could be used by writers, creators and <a href="/wiki/notes/1p0hitgrhj81k4xku9iyzb1">Game Masters</a> to help create scenarios, worlds, and systems of their own that could then be easily shared, adapted, and remixed. </p>
<p>It's the "distributed, interoperable, and well-defined" vision of the Semantic Web applied to the realm of imagination.</p>
<p>Role-playing software based on open conceptualizations and Semantic Web technologies will empower people to connect, play, and learn together, in meat-space and online.</p>
<p>And as a side-effect, I think the innovations and momentum these kinds of applications would generate could bring the Semantic Web to life more broadly and make virtul reality actually enjoyable to boot.</p>

<p>My intended audience here is a general one: people who might be interested in story-telling, role-playing, video games, virtual reality, creativity, AI, or a bit of philosophy. </p>
<p>If you might be interested in the more technical side of this vision, check out my other blog, <a href="/wiki/">The Old Man in the Cave</a>. </p>

<p>Humanity is only beginning to realise the mind-blowing potential of computer-assisted role-playing, perhaps soon to be known as CARP.</p>
<p>Right now, this new medium looks and plays a lot like drama club meets primitive video games. Which is great. I expect we'll always have "retro-carp" as a beautiful option.</p>
<p>Soon though, role-playing will be more accessible, smoother, richer, and dramatically more cinematic than we could've imagined before the advent of intelligent computers. </p>
<p>It's going to be wild!</p>
<h2 id="postscript-why-carpe-noctem">Postscript: Why Carpe Noctem?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#postscript-why-carpe-noctem"></a></h2>
<p>At least since <a href="/wiki/notes/mmtujkakfvlae6pwekczfc6">Dead Poets Society</a>, the Latin phrase <em><a href="/wiki/notes/2sxpnftl25g1vk4nt3guj6i">Carpe Diem</a></em> has come to mean "seize the day." Essentially, grab life by the horns. </p>
<p>But as <a href="/wiki/notes/gfsrtlv94ywathmphykh47s">Jack Shepherd</a> beautifully explores in <a href="https://medium.com/the-cellar-door/carpe-diem-doesnt-mean-seize-the-day-770fbf63a820">“Carpe Diem” Doesn’t Mean “Seize the Day”</a>, a more accurate translation is "pluck the day." It's a horticultural metaphor about gathering or harvesting the fruits of life.</p>
<p>But what about the night? </p>
<p>Like most entertainment, role-playing gaming is often fitted in after work hours. Typical sessions last three to five hours and often stretch past midnight. All-nighters are glamorized legend-fodder. Pluck those zombies, harvest the magic items, and seize the stronghold before the sun comes up!</p>
<p>Writing too has its nocturnal mystique. <a href="/wiki/notes/aollktezkvx0z0bxejrbr9g">James Baldwin</a> wrote in <a href="/wiki/notes/njp9yjeexmhuimj3al6yoi5">Nothing Personal</a> about how the grim realizations of 4am (a "devastating hour"), could in turn be a source of strength. <a href="/wiki/notes/g2gp99n23xwfmcsgt61ax0w">Kafka</a> wrote ruefully of sleep: "Just think how many thoughts a blanket smothers while one lies alone in bed." Proust, Plath, Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot and George Sand are among the many writers famed to do their best work at night. </p>
<p>Regardless of quality, as the father of a wakeful two year old, <a href="/wiki/notes/aupqq2yswtykk0z003zk5sj">night time is often write time</a> for me.</p>
