<p>Core Concepts
Entities</p>
<p>Entities are the primary nodes in the knowledge graph. Each entity has:</p>
<pre><code>A unique name (identifier)
An entity type (e.g., "person", "organization", "event")
A list of observations
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>{
"name": "John_Smith",
"entityType": "person",
"observations": ["Speaks fluent Spanish"]
}</p>
<p>Relations</p>
<p>Relations define directed connections between entities. They are always stored in active voice and describe how entities interact or relate to each other.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>{
"from": "John_Smith",
"to": "Anthropic",
"relationType": "works_at"
}</p>
<p>Observations</p>
<p>Observations are discrete pieces of information about an entity. They are:</p>
<pre><code>Stored as strings
Attached to specific entities
Can be added or removed independently
Should be atomic (one fact per observation)
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>{
"entityName": "John_Smith",
"observations": [
"Speaks fluent Spanish",
"Graduated in 2019",
"Prefers morning meetings"
]
}</p>
