<p><strong>Symbolic play</strong>, also known as <strong>pretend play</strong> or <strong>imaginative play</strong>, refers to the type of play where children use objects, actions, or ideas to represent other objects, actions, or ideas as a form of creative expression. In symbolic play, children assign new meanings to objects or actions, such as pretending a <strong>block is a car</strong> or a <strong>stick is a sword</strong>. It allows them to explore the world, experiment with different social roles, and express their thoughts and feelings in a creative and non-literal way.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cognitive Development</strong>: According to <strong>Jean Piaget</strong>, symbolic play helps children move from the sensorimotor stage to the preoperational stage by allowing them to use mental symbols and engage in representational thought (Piaget, 1962).</li>
<li><strong>Language Development</strong>: Pretend play encourages children to use language in creative ways, helping them to expand their vocabulary and practice new words (Vygotsky, 1978).</li>
<li><strong>Social Skills</strong>: When children engage in pretend play with peers, they learn negotiation, empathy, and cooperation.</li>

<h3 id="age-range">Age Range:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#age-range"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Symbolic play usually begins around <strong>18 months to 2 years</strong> of age, as children develop the ability to represent objects and actions mentally.</li>
<li>It continues to evolve in complexity as children grow, reaching a peak in the <strong>preschool years (ages 3-6)</strong>, where children start to create elaborate, rule-based pretend scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>Symbolic play is a vital aspect of early childhood development that contributes to language, social, and cognitive growth, helping children make sense of the world around them in creative ways. </p>
