## Description

- synset is a set of cognitively equivalent synonyms, plus a gloss, organized into a semantic network with relations like hyponymy, meronymy, and entailment.

## Issues

- type-instance distinction is valuable, but no distinction between what kind of types, e.g., dwarf and architect are kinds of Person.
