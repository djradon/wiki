<p>Welcome to my developer journal. I’ve been wanting to try <a href="/wiki/notes/9pjzuklc0yn3wsz97x4ybhq">learning in public</a> and I hope this thing will boost my motivation, improve my writing, and put a finer point on some of my ideas. I’m also looking to make connections that could lead to collaboration. So here we are.</p>
<h2 id="spoiler-alert-its-a-machine">Spoiler Alert: It’s a Machine<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#spoiler-alert-its-a-machine"></a></h2>
<p>In the eponymous Twilight Zone episode from 1959, the old man in the cave is secretly a computer that keeps the local townsfolk alive by giving them the information they need (through an intermediary, their leader Goldsmith) to survive in a radioactive, post-apocalyptic world. They end up destroying the computer in the name of freedom, and then everyone except Goldsmith dies of radiation poisoning. </p>
<p>It’s a story about secular faith and a nice example of the <a href="/wiki/notes/whqqfchsiczmn7yvlwqvl84">Benevolent AI</a> trope.</p>
<p>In the context of this developer journal, the Old Man is a metaphor for synthetic intelligence and how we can use digital tools and digitized information to help humanity.</p>

<p>I’m on a mission to help people build, deconstruct, remix, and engage with the <a href="/wiki/notes/1lgt9498s72qyk2leyj00pb">cultural multiverse</a> through <a href="/wiki/notes/vdligrphd3nnqieslle2hhf">computer-assisted roleplay</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/x27pobn88jv8gp8h3l36hn5">interactive drama</a>, and <a href="/wiki/notes/ly8z6maiioqzaj4awcm2e3c">applied ontology</a>. </p>
<p>The dream: playable alternate realities that draw on our collective cultural history and inspire our engagement. Anyone can enjoy these realities, even the non-technical can create them, and the overall experience can easily be meaningful and immersive. It might look like a drama-filled version of the <a href="/wiki/notes/XiX7ubWup9r6A6agrUSR4">metaverse</a>, although <a href="/wiki/notes/XiX7ubWup9r6A6agrUSR4#^pdbekjzfr2l0">I do not love that term</a>. </p>
<p>But it could also look like <a href="/wiki/notes/bj37ohw9n2lffh1t771l4lv">improv theater</a> or <a href="/wiki/notes/f8k89kt1om3zsyzftdxhak8">pen-and-paper roleplaying</a>, perhaps with software standing by inobtrusively, documenting and ready to assist.</p>
<p>It’ll be made possible by a corresponding, new-ish art form. Call it digital adventure production, roleplay experience curation, or <a href="/wiki/notes/3mgnxtge7uoc2mj3u564tgf">the electric magic store</a>. It will weave together aspects of film, video games, immersive theatre, and role-playing. You can think of it as the spiritual successor of today’s <a href="/wiki/notes/bKzmyGQZRf8Z7VcQ3gg9m">virtual tabletops</a>.</p>
<p>In additional to imagination, artistry, production skills, and some supporting software, this dream requires distributed, interoperable, and well-defined data. Which just happens to be the vision of the <a href="/wiki/notes/178ZuAuS3pVbx4PGWgAWj">Semantic Web</a>.</p>
<p>So in addition to my main mission to make this dream a reality, I have a technical side-quest to reboot the Semantic Web. </p>
<h2 id="making-the-semantic-web-usable">Making the Semantic Web Usable<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#making-the-semantic-web-usable"></a></h2>
<p>As I mentioned, the vision of the Semantic Web is simple: distributed, interoperable, and well-defined data.</p>
<p>The threads of the Semantic Web are <a href="/wiki/notes/cQHSPbwz5JLE40UxftY7w">RDF</a> statements composed of a subject, a predicate, and an object. The form is beautiful in its simplicity. For example:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">the-old-man-in-the-cave</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">helped</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">goldsmith</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
<span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">goldsmith</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">helped</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">the-townsfolk</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Theoretically, you can say anything with an interlinked collection of subject-predicate-object triples. It’s a graph-based universal data language. But of course, the devil is in the details.</p>
<p>I want to heed <a href="/wiki/notes/19rtafmmi2oxrj1gudbzom6">Manu Sporny</a>’s 2014 <a href="/wiki/notes/svak6dc31aevjrz7qb7pn8u">call-to-arms</a>:“If you want to make the Semantic Web a reality, stop making the case for it and spend your time doing something more useful, like actually making machines smarter or helping people publish data in a way that’s useful to them.” </p>
<p>Turns out that making machines smarter was the easy part!</p>
<p>With the current state of the art, publishing <em>any</em> semantic data, let alone useful data, is hard. In a word, the most important theme for wider SW adoption is <strong>usability</strong>. </p>
<p>I’ve got some ideas for how to make data publishing free and easy for everyone. So that should help usability.</p>
<p>To make the data useful, we’ll need to address some long-simmering issues around RDF: <a href="/wiki/notes/gksoywxa18kxwc9g8r7b2v8">temporality</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/IGbXj1wV729HmvRvfvdh9">provenance</a>, hypotheticals, <a href="/wiki/notes/642rps5rnft64gludyncf6o">probabilities</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/958prd17uz4tl31043g4ai1">n-ary relationships</a>, and <a href="/wiki/notes/64ugzw02qgdm4umxjzj2mv1">multi-level theory</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t even get me started on the state of <a href="/wiki/notes/lTim9plsY3OzVv6gn7TBR">RDF-star</a>.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of gaps around SW infrastructure and best practices that have had me searching for solutions and dreaming up my own. </p>
<p>In the trenches of academia, industry, open-source, and the World Wide Web Consortium, the Semantic Web has gotten bogged down. I guess we should’ve expected it to take a while to iron the kinks out of something as ambitious as a universal data language. Still, it’s been almost 25 years!</p>
<p>The time is right to forge a path forward. And I’d bet the old man in the cave can help us out.</p>
<h2 id="other-likely-topics">Other Likely Topics<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#other-likely-topics"></a></h2>
<p>I’m interested in and wary of AI (better termed <a href="/wiki/notes/575ksgxk3fm8rsvoklrooao">synthetic intelligence</a>) and how it can help people create <a href="/wiki/notes/x27pobn88jv8gp8h3l36hn5">interactive drama</a> and <a href="/wiki/notes/pj32k7apctfv8jzel8788ff">virtual worlds</a>. Things like <a href="/wiki/notes/3d0xlnote24s74cr51px8eh">GraphRAG</a> and <a href="/wiki/notes/b9lsygaxwuxo8w88z5zwmvd">agentic systems</a> are highly relevant.</p>
<p>At the moment, I’m especially interested in <em>data modeling</em> and how to represent things like characters, scenarios, play histories, and evolving worlds. </p>
<p>In the near term, I’m hoping to start developing some open upper-level and meta-conceptualizations, i.e., ontologies, and weave together some publishing infrastructure. After that, I aim to start making software that can use these ontologies to support roleplaying.</p>
<p>I enjoy <a href="/wiki/notes/g8d9f5k3yi5teky19yrkwia">astronaut architecture</a> but want to actually build stuff too. So I intend to touch on relevant topics in <a href="/wiki/notes/Nj0zV6xVAyURP3Dpk8lfh">data science</a> and <a href="/wiki/notes/0qh4smppnx90isobvuhgk3d">software development</a> including <a href="/wiki/notes/WMFO8ef7AAsM4LHbYYSFQ">visualization</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/u8eiixbkcrl3ubp1ckdn3ud">home-cooked software</a>, and <a href="/wiki/notes/hen8ctyrj7os642b18kzzy5">geographic information systems</a>. </p>
