<p>Welcome to my developer journal. </p>
<p>I'm on a mission to help people build, deconstruct, remix, and engage with the <a href="/wiki/notes/1lgt9498s72qyk2leyj00pb">multiverse</a> through <a href="/wiki/notes/x27pobn88jv8gp8h3l36hn5">interactive drama</a>.</p>
<p>The vision is accessible virtual realities (in the broadest sense) worthy of our engagement and the continued development of the corresponding new-ish artform, <a href="/wiki/notes/vdligrphd3nnqieslle2hhf">computer-assisted role-play (CARP)</a>, that weaves together aspects of film, video games, role-playing games, and immersive theatre.</p>
<p>I like to think of it as <a href="/wiki/notes/3mgnxtge7uoc2mj3u564tgf">The Magic Store</a> gone digital. In additional to imagination, production skills, and artistry, it will require distributed, interoperable, and well-defined data. Which just happens to be the vision of the <a href="/wiki/notes/178ZuAuS3pVbx4PGWgAWj">Semantic Web</a>.</p>
<p>So in addition to my main public mission to map out the conceptual landscape of <a href="/wiki/notes/vdligrphd3nnqieslle2hhf">computer-assisted role-play</a> here, I have a technical side-quest to reboot the Semantic Web. </p>

<p>In the eponymous Twilight Zone episode from 1959, the old man in the cave is secretly a computer that keeps the local townsfolk alive by giving them the information they need (through an intermediary, their leader Goldsmith) to survive in a radioactive, post-apocalyptic world. They end up destroying the computer in the name of freedom, and then everyone except Goldsmith dies of radiation poisoning. </p>
<p>It's a story about secular faith and a nice example of the <a href="/wiki/notes/whqqfchsiczmn7yvlwqvl84">Benevolent AI</a> trope.</p>
<p>So in the context of this developer journal, the Old Man is a metaphor for synthetic intelligence and how we can use digitized information to help humanity.</p>

<p>The vision of the Semantic Web is simple: distributed, interoperable, and well-defined data.</p>
<p>The threads of the Semantic Web are <a href="/wiki/notes/cQHSPbwz5JLE40UxftY7w">RDF</a> statements composed of a subject, a predicate, and an object. The form is beautiful in its simplicity. For example:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">the-old-man-in-the-cave</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">helped</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">goldsmith</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
<span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">goldsmith</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">helped</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">the-townsfolk</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But of course, the devil is in the details.</p>
<p>I want to heed <a href="/wiki/notes/19rtafmmi2oxrj1gudbzom6">Manu Sporny</a>'s 2014 <a href="/wiki/notes/svak6dc31aevjrz7qb7pn8u">call-to-arms</a>: "If you want to make the Semantic Web a reality, stop making the case for it and spend your time doing something more useful, like actually making machines smarter or helping people publish data in a way thatâ€™s useful to them." </p>
<p>Turns out that making machines smarter was the easy part!</p>
<p>With the current state of the art, publishing <strong>any</strong> semantic data is still hard, let alone useful data. In a word, the most important theme for wider SW adoption is <strong>usability</strong>. </p>
<p>I've got some ideas for how to make data publishing free and easy for everyone. So that should help usability.</p>
<p>To make published data useful, we'll need to address some long-simmering issues around RDF expressivity: <a href="/wiki/notes/gksoywxa18kxwc9g8r7b2v8">temporality</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/IGbXj1wV729HmvRvfvdh9">provenance</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/958prd17uz4tl31043g4ai1">n-ary relationships</a>, hypotheticals, <a href="/wiki/notes/642rps5rnft64gludyncf6o">probabilities</a>, and <a href="/wiki/notes/64ugzw02qgdm4umxjzj2mv1">multi-level theory</a>.</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on the state of <a href="/wiki/notes/lTim9plsY3OzVv6gn7TBR">RDF-star</a>.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of gaps around SW infrastructure and best practices that have had me searching for solutions and dreaming up my own. I've got a glimmer of a solution to the <a href="/wiki/notes/c8fGFc04CU0O6zEOgg8OT#possible-solutions">httpRange-14 issue</a>, for example. Stay tuned next week!</p>
<p>In the trenches of academia, industry, and the World Wide Web Consortium, the Semantic Web has gotten bogged down. </p>
<p>I guess we should've expected it to take a while to iron the kinks out of something as ambitious as a universal data language. Still, it's been almost 25 years!</p>
<p>But it looks to me like the time is right to forge a path forward. And I'd bet the old man in the cave can help us out.</p>
<h2 id="likely-topics">Likely Topics<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#likely-topics"></a></h2>
<p>At the moment, I'm especially interested in role-playing <em>data modeling</em> and how to represent things like characters, stories, and evolving worlds. To that end, I'll be writing about <a href="/wiki/notes/ly8z6maiioqzaj4awcm2e3c">applied ontology</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/66dk16y00kliwyvtdewtmm8">linked data</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/rznysnkafjh4q2d4bhyo5y7">semantic methodologies</a>, virtual reality, and <a href="/wiki/notes/hen8ctyrj7os642b18kzzy5">geographic information systems</a></p>
<p>In the near term, I'm hoping to develop some upper-level and meta-conceptualizations, i.e., ontologies, with related best practices, and weave together some publishing infrastructure.</p>
<p>I'm also interested in and wary of AI (better termed <a href="/wiki/notes/575ksgxk3fm8rsvoklrooao">synthetic intelligence</a>) and how it can help people role-play and create <a href="/wiki/notes/x27pobn88jv8gp8h3l36hn5">interactive drama</a>. Things like <a href="/wiki/notes/3d0xlnote24s74cr51px8eh">GraphRAG</a> and <a href="/wiki/notes/b9lsygaxwuxo8w88z5zwmvd">agentic systems</a> are highly relevant.</p>
<p>I intend to touch on related topics in <a href="/wiki/notes/Nj0zV6xVAyURP3Dpk8lfh">data science</a> and <a href="/wiki/notes/0qh4smppnx90isobvuhgk3d">software development</a> including <a href="/wiki/notes/S4f5S0VDSYldAutlv7iZT">software architecture</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/WMFO8ef7AAsM4LHbYYSFQ">visualization</a> and <a href="/wiki/notes/6qcdytxfeftwhmxoro5nwsd">product design</a>. </p>
