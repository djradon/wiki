## Highlights

- We have a common, general-purpose world ontology. Most classes, like ‘Person’ and ‘Action’, are defined here. Inheriting the world ontology and adding more specialized knowledge shared by multiple scenarios—locations, props, characters and basic task structures—is the scenario family level. This allows us easily to share certain information over a set of closely-related scenarios. Finally, at the lowest level, we have a scenario ontology that stores scenario-specific information.
