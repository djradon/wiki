<ul>
<li>The modern concept originates in the semiotic theory of <a href="/wiki/notes/7j9bc5v543e1rvy47na1u0i">@charles-sanders-peirce</a>, in which indexicality is one of the three fundamental sign modalities by which a sign relates to its referent (the others being iconicity and symbolism)</li>
<li>Words and expressions in language often derive some part of their referential meaning from indexicality.
<ul>
<li>For example, I indexically refers to the entity that is speaking; now indexically refers to a time frame including the moment at which the word is spoken; and here indexically refers to a locational frame including the place where the word is spoken.</li>
<li>Linguistic expressions that refer indexically are known as deictics</li>
