<ul>
<li>In contrast to Resource_Description_Framework|RDF as standard model für data interchange on the Web, <strong>Ontology4 uses quadrupels instead of triplets and adds the time dimension for every relation between subjects and objects.</strong></li>
<li>Ontology4 provides standardized notation for subjects/objects (^), relations (&#x3C;>), instances (>), methods (°) and verbs/activities (~). Each of the symbols has its own graphical symbol in the semantical net graphs.</li>
<li>PQL (Predicate Query Language) translates to OQL (Ontology Query Language)</li>

<h3 id="dualism">Dualism<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dualism"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class-Attribute Dualism</strong> has two approaches
<ol>
<li>class has a property, and instances are members of class, e.g.: particularPerson is a Person, and has gender</li>
<li>subclasses of a class have restrictions, and instances can be members of both classes, e.g.: particularPerson is a MalePerson and FemalePerson</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>"But only the second approach allows to model hermaphrodites by letting an instance >Instance-H1 be instance of the subclasses ^Class-F and ^Class-M at the same time. In the first approach, this can not be done, since then the attribute .Attribute-G would have to have the two values male AND female for >Instance-H1 like"
<ul>
<li>t.2024.06.06.09 but really? </li>
<li>t.2024.07.10.08 NO! functional properties can only have one, but gender doesn't need to be a functional property</li>

<li>model hierarchies of part-whole relations

<h3 id="taxoverbies">Taxoverbies<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#taxoverbies"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>hierarchies of verbs/activities</li>
<li>They parallel taxonomies as hierarchies of classes and mereologies as hierarchies of compositions/part-wholes.</li>
<li>t.2024.07.10.08 but verbs are similar to properties, and properties can have hierarchy in RDF</li>
