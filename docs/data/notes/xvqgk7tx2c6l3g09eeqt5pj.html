In this case it is actually the act of deciding it was a paperweight that made it one. So a state of a stone is a paperweight because someone (anyone) said so, and while they said so. There are, however, limits to the power of will. If I decide that the Empire State Building would make a nice paperweight, it does not become one simply by my act of will, so the object needs to be fit for purpose as well."</li>
