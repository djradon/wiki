<li>though there is a tendency to think of the computer as “the enemy of the book,” it is in fact “the child of print culture,” a powerful representational medium of its own that promises to continue the evolution of storytelling and “reshape the spectrum of narrative expression.”</li>
<li>Books are good at delivering essentially linear stories, she insists, while computers are good at telling stories of a different kind: procedural, participatory, encyclopedic, and spatial. And they’re particularly good at telling stories that reflect the digital age—stories about fractured realities, complex systems, and networked ways of being in the world.</li>
<li>Murray became devoted to creating “incunabula,” a term meaning “swaddling clothes” that is used by book historians to describe awkward experiments produced just after the invention of the printing press.

<li>She compares Myst, for instance, a seminal first-person adventure game from 1993, to the juvenilia of the Brontë sisters, who told stories to one another about tense dungeon-crawls in a “regressive, violent, overheated emotional universe.”</li>

<li>“walking simulator” was likely pejorative at first, rooted in a “misconception that there are two different categories, narrative and game, and you’re either one or the other.”</li>
<li>there is "a largely tortuous debate in game-studies circles between so-called ludologists <a href="/wiki/notes/kt0m0sxngg527mn2xoh7s2l">Ludology</a> and narratologists: people who wanted to study games as abstract systems, on the one hand, and people who wanted to study them as narrative experiences on the other."
<ul>
<li>the prominent video-game critic <a href="/wiki/notes/r5y3bpskszo7gva6cj4kirp">@ian-bogost</a>, a colleague of Murray’s at Georgia Tech, assailed her book one more time—without naming her or it directly—in a widely shared piece that was provocatively, if misleadingly, titled <a href="/wiki/notes/b1h0j78mhw4zmcvqtc8yr1f">Video Games Are Better Without Stories</a>.</li>
<li>ludologists want Tetris—or Candy Crush, or perhaps the screen itself—to be a refuge from narrative, she argues, because they’re embroiled in too much narrative already.</li>
<li>For some, “objections to the possibility of deeply meaningful digital narrative forms” are rooted in “empty expressions of nostalgia for older media artifacts.” </li>
<li>But for others it seems to be something else: a need to keep digital technology away from “the cultural and narrative dimensions of representation” altogether, as if it could remain a realm of pure function.</li>
