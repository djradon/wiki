<li>RDF isn't naturally immutable because a graph is a naturally a dynamic thing</li>
<li>if you want some degree of immutability, there's going to have to be a meta-lattice that points to "what's current" (as in valid)
<ul>
<li>or you could imagine relators that are all attached to an alias, and queries have to pick out the currently active one.</li>

<li>perhaps small collections of triples, aka <a href="/wiki/notes/sw2zkzcrtbm3k68mbhazrku">Micro Graphs</a> become the fundamental unit of data. </li>
<li>to keep track of history, i.e., successor and predecssor micro-graphs, use the <a href="/wiki/notes/crjzmwyil1nth9o6d3qdhdk">Meta Lattice</a> </li>
