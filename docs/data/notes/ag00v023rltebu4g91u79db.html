When the subject or the external observer looks at the noumenal cat, it is a phenomenal cat that they see. So we have a cat itself (the noumenal cat) whose  existence  and  nature  is  observer-independent,  and  a  seen  (phenomenal)  cat  that represents the noumenal cat, whose existence and nature is observer-dependent.  In everyday life we usually think of the cat we see as a “physical cat” and, for the purposes of everyday life, we usually treat it as being the cat itself rather than a representation of the cat itself.  But this does not double the number of actual cats, not does it ‘smear’ any additional phenomenal cats all  over  the  noumenal  cat.  Rather,  the one,  noumenal  cat  has  as  many  numerically  distinct appearances as there are views of it by individual observers.” (Velmans, 2008, p41) </p>

<p>The terms <strong>noumenal</strong> and <strong>phenomenal objects</strong> are rooted in the philosophy of <strong>Immanuel Kant</strong>, specifically his work in <strong>"Critique of Pure Reason"</strong>. These terms represent two different aspects of reality, distinguished by the <strong>limits of human perception</strong> and understanding.</p>
<h3 id="1-phenomenal-objects">1. <strong>Phenomenal Objects</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-phenomenal-objects"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>These are the objects that we experience and perceive in the world through our <strong>senses</strong>. In Kant's philosophy, the <strong>phenomenal realm</strong> refers to the <strong>world as we experience it</strong>, where objects are shaped by our sensory input and mental faculties.</li>
<li>The <strong>phenomenon</strong> is how things <strong>appear</strong> to us, not necessarily how they exist in themselves. According to Kant, human beings do not perceive the world directly; instead, we experience it through a "filter" of mental structures (space, time, causality) that allow us to make sense of sensory data.</li>
<li>Example: A tree as you see it (with color, shape, texture) is a <strong>phenomenal object</strong>, which exists in your perceptual world.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-noumenal-objects">2. <strong>Noumenal Objects</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-noumenal-objects"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Noumenal objects exist in the <strong>noumenal realm</strong>, which is the world as it exists <strong>independently of human perception</strong>—the <strong>thing-in-itself</strong> (or <strong>Ding an sich</strong> in German). Noumena are objects that exist, but they are beyond our capacity to know directly because they do not appear to us through sensory experience.</li>
<li>Kant argues that we cannot have direct knowledge of <strong>noumenal objects</strong> because our faculties of perception and understanding (space, time, causality) are limited to the phenomenal world. The noumenal realm is what lies <strong>beyond</strong> our experience, a domain that we can speculate about but never truly access.</li>
<li>Example: The <strong>tree-in-itself</strong>—the ultimate reality of the tree that exists independently of how it appears to you—is a noumenal object. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="distinction">Distinction:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#distinction"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phenomenal objects</strong> are objects as <strong>we perceive them</strong> through sensory experience, influenced by human cognition and perception.</li>
<li><strong>Noumenal objects</strong> are objects as they <strong>exist independently</strong> of our perception, in a realm beyond human understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kant's distinction is crucial to his theory of knowledge, as he believes that we can never have direct access to the noumenal world but are confined to knowledge about the <strong>phenomenal world</strong>—the world of appearances shaped by our perception. This distinction between the phenomenal and noumenal realms is central to his epistemology and metaphysics. </p>
