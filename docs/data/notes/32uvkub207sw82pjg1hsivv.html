<p>Top-level ontologies provide a set of foundational concepts that have a well-founded philosophical meaning, being a useful tool in ontology engineering. However, in practice, few domain ontologies integrate top-level concepts. One of the difficulties refers to the selection of appropriate top-level concepts. This paper presents an analysis of top-level categories of a set of well-known domain ontologies from ontology matching benchmarks. Our main hypothesis is that training classification models using only concept comments (i.e., rdfs:comment) from top-level concepts can improve reported results in the literature. We then consider the best classifiers to estimate the distribution of concepts from Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) ontologies aligned to DOLCE top-level concepts.</p>
