<p>An Information Content Entity (ICE) refers to any entity that represents some content that can be interpreted. Examples include data sets, documents, and pieces of software. The key characteristic of ICEs is that they have content that can be interpreted or understood by an agent (human or machine). ICEs are abstract entities; they do not have a physical form but rather exist as pieces of information.
Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A PDF document (the content, not the file itself)</li>
<li>The text of a book (regardless of whether it's printed on paper or displayed on a screen)</li>
<li>A piece of software code</li>
</ul>
