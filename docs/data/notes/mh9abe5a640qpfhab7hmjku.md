## Description

- they compile Jade 2.5+LEAP 2.1 with Microsoft Visual J#.NET. This results in a .NET DLL file that can be used from any .NET language (e.g. C#, VB.NET, ...) which means, it is possible to write a Jade/LEAP agent in these languages. For a LEAP.NET agent platform/container it is also possible to communicate with a LEAP agent running in a different platform/container beeing executed in Java. Hence, LEAP is becoming a way to interoperate between Java and .NET.
