<h2 id="features">Features<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#features"></a></h2>
<pre><code>System:
    Free, open source
    Cross-platform: runs on Mac, Windows, Linux, et al
    International character set support
Programming:
    Fully programmable
    Approachable syntax
    Language is Logo dialect extended to support agents
    Mobile agents (turtles) move over a grid of stationary agents (patches)
    Link agents connect turtles to make networks, graphs, and aggregates
    Large vocabulary of built-in language primitives
    Double precision floating point math
    First-class function values (aka anonymous procedures, closures, lambda)
    Runs are reproducible cross-platform
Environment:
    Command center for on-the-fly interaction
    Interface builder w/ buttons, sliders, switches, choosers, monitors, text boxes, notes, output area
    Info tab for annotating your model with formatted text and images
    HubNet: participatory simulations using networked devices
    Agent monitors for inspecting and controlling agents
    Export and import functions (export data, save and restore state of model, make a movie)
    BehaviorSpace, an open source tool used to collect data from multiple parallel runs of a model
    System Dynamics Modeler
    NetLogo 3D for modeling 3D worlds
    Headless mode allows doing batch runs from the command line
Display and visualization:
    Line, bar, and scatter plots
    Speed slider lets you fast forward your model or see it in slow motion
    View your model in either 2D or 3D
    Scalable and rotatable vector shapes
    Turtle and patch labels
APIs:
    controlling API allows embedding NetLogo in a script or application
    extensions API allows adding new commands and reporters to the NetLogo language; open source example extensions are included
