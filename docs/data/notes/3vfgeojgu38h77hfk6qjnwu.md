Directly integrating server-side development and client-side development, GWT takes the perspective that JavaScript is a bug to be solved and uses advanced compiler technology to allow developers to write in Java and generate dynamic, JavaScript based UIs in the Google style. The default widget set is a strict subset of those provided by Dijit, but GWT takes great pains to optimize all generated code. A growing trove of add-on libraries are available to enhance the default components. Unlike YUI and EXT, GWT is being run as a real Open Source project, allowing external committers, and doing development in the open while managing IP issues in a very sophisticated manner (CLAs, code review, etc. Much like Apache or Dojo).  GWT applications can only be written in Java and are most often deployed on Java containers. Good documentation is available and a thriving community is helpful.
