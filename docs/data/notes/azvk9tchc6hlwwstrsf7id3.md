## Highlights

- @immanuel-kant: "original nonsense is insufficient for creativity"

### Psychological vs Historical Creativity

- @margaret-boden: distinction between “psychologically creative” (P-creative) and “historically creative” (H-creative)
  - P-creativity is more fundamental. Anything that is new in all of history (H-creative) must also be new to its creator (P-creative)
