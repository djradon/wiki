<ul>
<li>Using RDF-Star simply encouraged poor modeling practice.</li>
<li>We abused RDF-Star because we used a facility for making statements about statements to instead make statements about doctor visits or airline flights.</li>
<li>"RDF-Star really is important, because it lets us address a lot of things about data usage that aren’t addressed in most data systems, including graph stores, document stores and relational stores, at all. If we want to know whether we want to trust a datum, a good way to figure that out is to look at its source. RDF-Star will let us do this directly. If we have some confidence in our data (or lack of confidence), we can annotate statements with some measure of confidence; maybe a probability estimate or some fuzzy measure. Temporal and bi-temporal reasoning is important in many situations; RDF-Star provides a way we can represent time scales on statement, in a standard, interoperable way."</li>
<li>There are probably more creative ways to appropriately use RDF-Star; some that come to mind when modeling policy is jurisdiction; under what jurisdictions is this policy statement valid? For data governance, who is allowed to know the content of this statement?</li>
<li>A visit to a doctor’s office isn’t some new thing I am inventing just to get around some deficiency in my modeling system
<ul>
<li>it’s actually the way I talk to my doctor’s office, and the way they officially communicate with me. </li>
<li>Furthermore, my visit summary includes an indication of the caregiver(s) and all the tests that were taken, along with their results. </li>
<li>The page “Visit Summary” looks a lot like Michael’s model.</li>
