<p>Here is an example hyper-schema that adds a single link, with the IANA-registered link relation type "self", that is built from an instance with one known object field named "id":</p>
<pre><code>{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "id": {
            "type": "number",
            "readOnly": true
        }
    },
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "self",
            "href": "thing/{id}"
        }
    ]
}
                
</code></pre>
<p>If the instance is {"id": 1234}, and its base URI according to <a href="https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-hypermedia.html#RFC3986">RFC 3986 section 5.1</a>, is "<a href="https://example.com/api/%22">https://example.com/api/"</a>, then "<a href="https://example.com/api/thing/1234%22">https://example.com/api/thing/1234"</a> is the resulting link's target URI.</p>
