## Features of Stochastic Clock Structures

- Random Timing Intervals:
  - The time between events (or ticks) in a stochastic clock is not fixed but follows a specific probability distribution. Common distributions include exponential, Poisson, and Gaussian distributions.

- Markov Processes:
  - Many stochastic clock models are based on Markov processes, where the probability of transitioning to the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of previous states.
