<li>"Capabilities are different from features and benefits as they’re the intermediary that connects a feature to the benefit. Capabilities help customers understand how a product’s features are beneficial. The best way to define a capability is to answer the question “what does this product allow me to do? Capabilities are different from <a href="/wiki/notes/ojf98wq4ypymut8h688kc26">benefits</a>. Benefits are emotions and feelings while capabilities are tasks or actions. Understanding the difference is key because when users seek a solution to their problem, they tend to focus on a task or capability that they want. If product development narrows its attention to only features and benefits, customers may fail to identify the connection between a product and what they need to accomplish."
