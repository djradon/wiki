<li>Data is a key asset of any person, organization, and society.</li>
<li>Data is self-describing and does not rely on an application for interpretation and meaning.</li>
<li>Data is expressed in open, non-proprietary formats.</li>
<li>Access to and security of the data is a responsibility of the enterprise data layer or the personal data vault, and not managed by applications.</li>
<li>Applications are allowed to visit the data, perform their magic and express the results of their process back into the data layer.</li>
