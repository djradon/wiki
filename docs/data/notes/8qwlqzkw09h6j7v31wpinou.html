<li><a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">@stefan-schulz (Private)</a>: My problem with the word "entity" is that nobody could convincingly show me any non-entity up to now... The word "entity" is also very ambiguous. It has a technical meaning in OWL, it is used in the NLP community as short form for "named entity" and designates either linguistic signs or their referents (which adds more confusion to the term).</li>
<li><a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">@pierre-grenon (Private)</a>: Suppose you nevertheless do the label change proposed. As you point out, this is because of the extensional equivalence between Entity and Particular in the BFO-2020 OWL-- I agree with you that it extends because the underlying interpretation of the particular universal distinction in published OWL implementations has consistently been the same. Yet as you also articulate, it is also based on the current view. Suppose the view changes and moves towards one in which universals are added to the domain. When you add universals, will you reinstate an Entity class to subsume Universal and Particular? Why do it this way instead of adding -- say, as a fragment the distinction you want to have.</li>
