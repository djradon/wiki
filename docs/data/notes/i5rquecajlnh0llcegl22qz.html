<p>"who is the you in a second person point of view story? There are actually a few different possibilities:</p>
<p>  The narrator is addressing the reader</p>
<p>  The narrator is addressing themselves</p>
<p>  The narrator is addressing another character"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pros">Pros<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pros"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In a second person narrative, the writer casts the reader as the main character. <strong>The reader is placed at the very centre of the story</strong>, which makes for an intense and immersive reader experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This POV can also be used <strong>to reinforce the key themes and ideas of the story</strong>. Perhaps the narrator wants to distance themselves from their own narrative because the topic is difficult to think or talk about. Or perhaps self-talk is central to your narrator's identity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second person POV is an exciting challenge for a writer</strong>. And an original and intriguing format for a reader. To avoid putting too much pressure on either party, short stories written in the second person provide a good introduction to this mode of storytelling.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cons">Cons<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cons"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s not something writers or readers are used to</strong>. It’s rare to come across fiction written in the second person. And – honestly – writers don’t tend to consider it as one of the narrative formats available to them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Readers don’t always like it</strong>. They may feel uncomfortable or alienated from events when being told by a narrator that they have acted or spoken in ways that feel far removed from their own real life experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because readers don’t tend to like second person point of view narratives, <strong>it’s much harder to convince an agent or publisher</strong> that your story has commercial potential.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A reader will inevitably question this form of storytelling. So a writer has to convince the reader that the second person point of view is necessary to the narrative. <strong>Very few stories really require it</strong> – so writers simply choose other points of view.</li>
