  - #summary "During the optimization phase, an optimizer algorithm, such as hill-climbing, simulated annealing, or the Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to work with the population, locating the best possible knob settings for the given representation. In practice, in the actual implementation, a deme is just a set of scored instances. This is because all instances in a deme share the same representation, field set and knob mapping."
