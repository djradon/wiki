<p><a href="/wiki/notes/k1y8afp4mxyrgxy0yngkn28">@andre-demori</a>: "Hello, I am working on a conceptual model using UFO constructs that is also based on Multi-Level Theory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, when I import gUFO, I am encountering a problem when defining attribute values ​​(data properties) for Individuals that are also types (punning).</p>
<p>However, it seems that gUFO does not support MLT, since properties that are classified as hasQualityValue can only be defined for an Individual and not for a type. When I do this, the reasoner says that there is an ontological inconsistency.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to know if you have already encountered this problem and if there is an immediate solution. If not, I would like to leave this recommendation for future extensions."</p>

<li><a href="/wiki/notes/rha7xw4r9kuxyub1urvjqnv">@joao-paulo-almeida</a>:  Indeed, gUFO enforces a dichotomy between types and individuals. This means that types can't bear aspects (as only concrete individuals can). A workaround is to use regular object/data properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have been discussing a possible relaxation of some of the domain/range declarations (e.g., the domain of gufo:hasQualityValue and the range of gufo:inheresIn) to include types in addition to concrete individuals. This would be an easy way to accommodate the view of types as endurants and would not impact existing gUFO-based ontologies.</p>
<p>(See <a href="/wiki/notes/irpbecuanb3c1sa3fa2q23m">Incorporating Types of Types in Ontology Driven Conceptual Modeling</a> for how we address types as endurants in UFO more broadly.)</p>
