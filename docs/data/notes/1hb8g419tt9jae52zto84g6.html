<p>...the difference between rules and ontologies is not merely pedagogical. In the cases we consider, rules typically can help to express knowledge that cannot be formulated in RDFS or OWL. At the same time, there are also various features of OWL that rule languages do not provide, so a natural question to ask is how the strengths of OWL and of rules can be combined. It turns out that this is indeed possible, but that the added power often also comes at the price of higher complexity and more difficult implementation. The rule languages discussed in this chapter have therefore been chosen to be the ones for which a combination with RDF and OWL is not just possible in principle, but for which this combination is also practically supported by software tools and, in some cases, by upcoming standards.</p>
