<p>Yes, the term "relator-based predication" could be a suitable way to describe a preference for reified, relator-based relationship specification in RDF. In the context of RDF and ontologies, "predication" refers to the act of stating or asserting a property or relationship about a subject. By incorporating "relator-based," the term specifically emphasizes the use of relators (or relationships modeled as intermediary entities) to express these assertions.</p>
<p>This approach aligns with ontological theories, such as those found in the OntoClean methodology or the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), where relations (relators) are often treated as first-class entities that connect other entities. "Relator-based predication" would emphasize the use of these intermediary entities (relators) for more complex and explicit relationship modeling in RDF, as opposed to using simple direct predicates.</p>
<p>So, "relator-based predication" effectively conveys the method and philosophy behind using relators for relationship specification in RDF.</p>
