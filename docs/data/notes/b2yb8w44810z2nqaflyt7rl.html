<p>The main paradigmatic differences of Intend, compared to GTD-based systems are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>choosing &#x26; doing, over organizing</li>
<li>aliveness, instead of exhaustiveness
<ul>
<li>the to-do list has more inflow than outflow, meaning it gets longer and longer</li>
<li>lots of low-value tasks get added and never removed, although they may still create guilt — even though it is not actually worth ever doing them!</li>
<li>when the person gains a new understanding of how it makes sense to approach that project/goal, old obsolete tasks don’t get cleared</li>
<li>(they may not even realize there's a contradiction between their new understanding and their old tasks)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>goals as fundamental, rather than tasks</li>
<li>proactive, rather than reactive</li>
</ul>

<p>The main way that the app currently embodies this philosophy is by not offering any place in the app to write down a bunch of stuff that you're not planning to work on yet and may never work on. It's not that we think such lists are not valuable—they are. But they have costs, and one of those costs is that people get too focused on keeping the list organized, at the expense of focusing on what they're actually trying to achieve and taking actions towards achieving those things.</p>

<li>
<p>"almost nobody I've met actually consistently does the GTD weekly review (which means they aren't actually following the GTD system, but a hollow shell of GTD that nobody ever claimed would work)."</p>
