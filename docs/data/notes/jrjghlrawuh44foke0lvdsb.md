## Highlights

### Introduction

- Spatiotemporal individuals on [the macro-physical level] are classified into objects, processes,facts, and situations.
- GFO’s ontology of space [5], (as well as that of time) is heavily inspired by @franz-brentano
  - the theory of boundaries provides an appropriate understanding of dimension in space.
  - A similar idea of dimension was developed by @karl-menger

### Modular Architecture of GFO 2.0

- Monolithic design of an ontology, similarly as in the case of other types of software components, imposes problems with its complexity that hinder the usability, maintenance and scalability [^11]
