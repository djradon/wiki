<p><em>a grim survey of RDF data management apps</em></p>
<h2 id="has-it-been-two-weeks-already">Has it been two weeks already?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#has-it-been-two-weeks-already"></a></h2>
<p>Actually, it’s been three weeks since my <a href="https://theoldmaninthecave.substack.com/p/lets-reboot-the-semantic-web-with-alternate-realities">first dev journal post</a> and <a href="https://djradon.substack.com/p/introducing-carpe-noctem">first general article</a>.</p>
<p>Why so long? Those combined ~3500 words were so agonized that I’m still recovering. Also wanted to get some work worth writing about done. I’ve been going from minus one to zero for long enough already. </p>
<p>So I've made some progress on my <a href="/wiki/notes/c5qcd8cate4ic318mkmmkn0">hot-shot foundational ontology</a>. I'll provide an update on that soon. Progress might've been quicker but I’ve been down many gopher holes, including planning for a <a href="/wiki/notes/ggw3ek46ptgebsgxgihr1dh">semantic static site generator</a>, a review of the <a href="/wiki/notes/pi9eqxk27aaedm6ae8tn180">w3c Data Catalog</a> standard, and today’s topic: a review of currently available authoring tools for Semantic Web data.</p>
<p><img src="/wiki/assets/images/2024-10-08-10-10-13.png"></p>
<p>I'd like this dev journal to be somewhat frequent and less distracting. So I might have to lower my standards and just <a href="/wiki/notes/9pjzuklc0yn3wsz97x4ybhq">publicize some learnings</a>, goddammit. Judging from my ChatGPT chat histories, there are more than enough learnings to choose from. I can save the over-polishing for my other blog, <a href="/wiki/notes/k8968ewb80th5714d816enb">Carpe Noctem</a>.</p>
<p>So anyhow, I’m raring to go on this <a href="/wiki/notes/3fa0re3cagbpf2ne3f0rsfe">foundational ontology</a> and accompanying example data. Let me just open my go-to RDF tools...</p>
<h2 id="the-usual-suspects">The Usual Suspects<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-usual-suspects"></a></h2>
<h3 id="vscode-and-jetbrains">VSCode and JetBrains<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#vscode-and-jetbrains"></a></h3>
<p>I’ve been composing little bits of raw RDF in <a href="/wiki/notes/Zky5xjNTxp2PENk30AyVs">Turtle</a> “by hand” with my <del>preferred text editor</del> all-time-favorite software, <a href="/wiki/notes/QcGJOGoacQKTGmnp3sK8J">VSCode</a>. Turtle is the most human-readable of the various RDF syntaxes and with the handy <a href="/wiki/notes/k435qlp9xsvxvjtfpez4x9p">Stardog RDF extension</a> for syntax checking and highlighting, the experience is pretty good. </p>
<p>If you prefer the <a href="/wiki/notes/wgujg6cyyjwyp9x20dj03w0">Jetbrains</a> IDEs, apparently the <a href="/wiki/notes/i3gwo61jgz50o8jsxb30cph">Rdf and Sparql extension</a> plugin is the best thing since sliced arrays. For €5 / month, you can query local RDF files with <a href="/wiki/notes/ln6efm5dgf1lqtozblp35bk">SPARQL</a> and validate <a href="/wiki/notes/ahbj9ejugov8rjiywj5qqc8">Shacl</a>. Pretty cool. </p>
<p>I wouldn’t recommend either path for non-coders though. And I’ve definitely found myself wishing for a more purpose-built tool.</p>
<h3 id="protégé">Protégé<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#protégé"></a></h3>
<p>For a little GUI goodness, there's the hallowed and venerable <a href="/wiki/notes/hexrd109e9ac3r9e96ga8v3">Protégé</a> “ontology editor.” I put ontology editor in quotes here because there's been an <a href="/wiki/notes/14cgtu42xwfpwjh8gos00qr#its-so-annoying-that-applications-and-the-semantic-web-community-seem-to-refer-to-instance-data-as-an-ontology">annoying blurring of the line</a> between ontologies (i.e., conceptual schemas, also known as the “terminologic box” or t-box) and the facts and entities that use ontologies, aka instance data or the “assertional box” or a-box. I know it can be a hard line to draw, but apparently everything’s an ontology now.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I know Protégé is commonly used for instance data. Maybe that has to do with its mature <a href="/wiki/notes/6e91ngibft37q01totmir78">reasoner</a> support. Maybe it’s because the only people who create ontology-conforming instance data by hand are the people who created the ontology. If the tool ya know works, keep using it, am I right?</p>
<p>But Protégé doesn’t have source editing. It’s complicated and intimidating. And it’s not ideal for actual data management. </p>
<h3 id="topbraid-composer">Topbraid Composer<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#topbraid-composer"></a></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/notes/3irxfday05mpzz40iicc8ca">Topbraid Composer</a> is the other well-known GUI tool for the Semantic Web, but the free edition was discontinued in May 2020, and the paid “Maestro Edition” is $3450/year and no longer actively developed. <a href="/wiki/notes/8kw8du4tykrbugfc4v4t0oz">TopQuadrant</a> is focusing on <a href="/wiki/notes/srdnbhs6boc8e5dce7r9mfm">Topbraid EDG</a> which has neither a free version nor public pricing.</p>
<p>For me, not being able to see the source for more than one element at a time is disqualifying, but maybe I was just doing something wrong. Also, the old free edition didn’t seem to work with <a href="/wiki/notes/cws2vz3drugg149i058hz4n">Trig</a> (the “named graph” superset of Turtle), which might be a major issue for me. And like most products based on the <a href="/wiki/notes/407j16f7cz2tfmghljq76og">Eclipse IDE</a>, learning Composer might be a challenge for non-programmers.</p>
<p>Even so, Composer Free might be your best option for affordable, GUI-based RDF data management. You can find the slightly-hidden download <a href="https://archive.topquadrant.com/topbraid-composer-install/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-frustrating-search">A Frustrating Search<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#a-frustrating-search"></a></h2>
<p>I started looking for a friendlier, purpose-built <a href="/wiki/notes/w0s3iul0vzdrzi2iil61mc0">authoring tool</a>. Surely there’s something that allows you to <em>browse, create, and update RDF data</em> with a GUI!? Like <a href="/wiki/notes/2fjVaQvUHDY1QtvfHNmcj">Microsoft Excel</a> or <a href="/wiki/notes/8ysl7b0qfp29qf6jylruduz">Datagrip</a>, but for the Semantic Web. I mean, people have been doing this for 25 years!</p>
<p>You would expect a user-friendly data management app to have a simple means of entering and updating data. Helpful graph and hierarchy visualizations would be nice. It should also have guardrails:</p>
<ul>
<li>consistency checks</li>
<li>a revision history or per-object undo mechanism</li>
<li>wizards and other user-experience affordances for common workflows like setting up projects, commiting changes, and publishing datasets</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of tools interface with RDF data via <a href="/wiki/notes/ln6efm5dgf1lqtozblp35bk">Sparql</a>, so require backing from a compliant <a href="/wiki/notes/gt5ces6d39khjsoryihy6ce">triple store</a>. I'm envisioning using git to store RDF data, so for that use case, an authoring tool has to work with text files. Ideally, I’d want a stand-alone application that you can run disconnected on a laptop. (Local-first forever!)</p>
<p>There must be some good options, right?</p>
<h3 id="fluent-editor">Fluent Editor<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#fluent-editor"></a></h3>
<p>The only stand-alone alternative to Protégé and Composer that I could find was <a href="/wiki/notes/eqc0sx1n1wudmi6601l0u1q">Fluent Editor</a>. It’s quirky, doesn’t have direct source editing that I could find, and hasn’t been updated since 2015. I love the idea of using Controlled English for knowledge modeling, but LLMs are poised to do that in any language, controlled or not. </p>
<p>Fluent Editor was definitely ahead of its time, but I'd be suprised to hear of anyone using it in 2024.</p>
<h2 id="reddit-to-the-rescue">Reddit To the Rescue?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#reddit-to-the-rescue"></a></h2>
<p>While researching this article, I stumbled on a recent “<a href="/wiki/notes/qam1t76y0kjtzwjl47fpc5s">reddit post entitled Best Ontology Development Environment Tool?</a>”. <a href="/wiki/notes/irn9vaajhpi8gc93bzgy0d4">Daniel Bakas</a> of <a href="/wiki/notes/k6y61xy05kypkxpdvw5ooyk">Best RDF triplestore/graph database?</a> fame mentioned he's looking for tools suitable for “high-impact big scale projects.” But whatever the scope, his considerations are largely the same as mine.</p>
<h3 id="atomic">Atomic<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#atomic"></a></h3>
<p>One of the threads in Daniel’s post, from the creator of <a href="/wiki/notes/13s2lqwflayx6ft508wgzpw">Atomic Data</a>, <a href="/wiki/notes/mist15aof5be33fujp5r1az">Joep Meindertsma</a>, mentioned <a href="/wiki/notes/r7haeipou3w0kt8b06j5gmf">Atomicserver</a>. </p>
<p>Atomic Data is an exciting RDF-based alternative to the conventional semantic web. I particularly love its use of <a href="/wiki/notes/prbis54rvnvjcg4y74map4h">Event Sourcing</a>.</p>
<p>According to Joep, Atomic Server “now has an ontology editor with a nice UI, even shows the UML diagram.” </p>
<p>Sounds great, but...</p>
<p>I have some <a href="/wiki/notes/13s2lqwflayx6ft508wgzpw#thoughts">hesitations about the Atomic approach</a>, especially in view of my <a href="/wiki/notes/s5z9wyb92268nr1b0cyl20n">democratized alternate realities use case</a>. Primarily, it is too restrictive about being able to say anything about anything. My users have to be able to pick up other peoples' content and riff on it. </p>
<p>Another restrictive aspect of Atomic is that all data requires validation with an Atomic Schema before it’s stored on an Atomic-compatible service. I want something flexible where data can be created by hand, stored in Git repositories, and get forked easily. </p>
<p>Still, I admire the ambition, love the <a href="https://docs.atomicdata.dev/roadmap">strategy</a>, and depending on your use case, it might work for you.</p>
<h3 id="overkill-options">Overkill Options<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#overkill-options"></a></h3>
<p>The Reddit thread mentioned a few other web-based possibilities: LinkedDataHub, Metaphactory, Stardog Studio, and Semaphore.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/notes/76k77lkhmabk7paurrd27eb">LinkedDataHub</a> is an impressive, web-based, open-source Knowledge Graph platform that deserves an article of its own. Its target audience includes “researchers and data scientists” and “developers and data publishers.“ It inspires you, as a developer, to base your application on it.But, while it could be used for authoring RDF data, it seems like overkill as an authoring tool.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/notes/2c9qoloybsswav1gtpo5wx9">Metaphactory</a> is similar, but not open-source. And pricing isn't cheap, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=a04eaa90-2616-469a-a304-96d35bd77641">“starting from $13.03/hr or from $52,900.00/yr” on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/notes/i3wl9lu2o74nx66l013vqrf">Semaphore</a> looks to be the most overkill of all!</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/notes/5zarlvbzgnc7sug5cvmsems">Stardog Studio</a> looks slick and might fit the bill for an authoring tool if it worked with text files or even non-Stardog triple stores. I love that they have a free cloud offering though.</p>
<p>The consensus in the Reddit discussion seemed to be: if you’re comfortable using an IDE, making RDF data by hand is probably your best option.</p>
<h2 id="anything-else">Anything Else?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#anything-else"></a></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/notes/22193vpn9mrpiunwmsh5al5">VocBench</a> might be the best web-based alternative. You can install it locally and it seems to have caching and decent support for mixing local development with connected resources. It has options for history, validation, and undo. But it doesn’t seem to have a source editor and it has some <a href="/wiki/notes/h07vryk8k662pa29x609myn#limitations-of-vocbench">other limitations</a>.</p>
<p>There’s also the <a href="/wiki/notes/gio4ifhokgn7595s5o47h7c">Open Link Structured Data Editor (OSDE)</a>, which hasn’t seen an update in two years and doesn’t work with text files. Catchy name, tho.</p>
<p>Finally, there's <a href="/wiki/notes/u37pkmunxmv8id5r6x5vs8j">rdf4j Workbench</a>. You can enter RDF directly into an HTML &#x3C;textarea&#x26;rt;. </p>
<p><img src="/wiki/assets/images/2024-10-17-12-06-02.png"></p>
<p>A picture is worth a lot of words here, but I’ll spend some anyhow: If your text-oriented application has to be web-based, please use <a href="/wiki/notes/jmrg0saebd43eovn80uvwle">Monaco Editor</a>.</p>
<h3 id="solid">Solid?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#solid"></a></h3>
<p>At this point, I should probably mention <a href="/wiki/notes/y92NhrGekobR2uGJE2AqN">Solid</a>, an initiative/specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods. The vision is data is decoupled from applications, so that people are no longer locked into specific platforms simply because their data is held there. </p>
<p>It’s similar to Atomic Data and also exciting and ambitious, with a large and active developer community and commercial backing to boot. But while Solid is built on RDF, it’s not viable as a general RDF authoring tool. </p>
<p>It could benefit from one though.</p>
<h2 id="prognosis">Prognosis<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#prognosis"></a></h2>
<p>The situation is disappointing to say the least.</p>
<p>If we’re going to <a href="/wiki/notes/s5z9wyb92268nr1b0cyl20n">reboot the semantic web</a>, we’ll want a usable data editor that supports <a href="/wiki/notes/aunwev4s6r7605a2fmaqhgr">Local First</a> authoring, guided workflows and data guardrails.</p>
<p>For now, I guess I’ll be sticking with VSCode, but let me know if I’ve missed something. I’d love to be wrong here. </p>
<p>Also, let me know if you're interested in buildinng or backing a <a href="/wiki/notes/rydhquvp5xs87ib7lhufbnv">modern RDF data editor</a>! That’s a project I could sink my teeth into.</p>
