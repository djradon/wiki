<h3 id="verb-forms">Verb Forms<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#verb-forms"></a></h3>
<p>"Verb forms" refer to the various versions a verb can take depending on the context, function, or grammar requirement. They include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Base Form</strong>: The simple form of the verb without any endings (e.g., <em>run</em>, <em>write</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Past Form</strong>: Used for past actions, often ending in "-ed" for regular verbs (e.g., <em>ran</em>, <em>wrote</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Past Participle</strong>: Used in perfect tenses or passive voice, usually the same as the past form for regular verbs, but different for irregular verbs (e.g., <em>run</em> -> <em>run</em>, <em>write</em> -> <em>written</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Present Participle (Gerund)</strong>: The "-ing" form of the verb, used for continuous tenses or as a gerund (e.g., <em>running</em>, <em>writing</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Third Person Singular Form</strong>: The form of the verb used with "he, she, it" in the present tense, often ending in "-s" (e.g., <em>runs</em>, <em>writes</em>).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="verb-tense">Verb Tense<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#verb-tense"></a></h3>
<p>"Verb tense" refers to the time an action takes placeâ€”past, present, or future. It provides temporal context to an action or state and can also indicate continuity or completion. Common verb tenses include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Simple Tenses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Present Simple</strong>: Describes general truths or habitual actions (e.g., <em>She writes</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Past Simple</strong>: Describes completed actions in the past (e.g., <em>She wrote</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Future Simple</strong>: Describes actions that will happen in the future (e.g., <em>She will write</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous (Progressive) Tenses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Present Continuous</strong>: Describes ongoing actions in the present (e.g., <em>She is writing</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Past Continuous</strong>: Describes ongoing actions in the past (e.g., <em>She was writing</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Future Continuous</strong>: Describes actions that will be ongoing in the future (e.g., <em>She will be writing</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Perfect Tenses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Present Perfect</strong>: Describes actions that occurred at an unspecified time or have relevance to the present (e.g., <em>She has written</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Past Perfect</strong>: Describes actions completed before a certain point in the past (e.g., <em>She had written</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Future Perfect</strong>: Describes actions that will be completed by a certain point in the future (e.g., <em>She will have written</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Perfect Continuous Tenses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Present Perfect Continuous</strong>: Describes actions that began in the past and are still ongoing or have recently finished (e.g., <em>She has been writing</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Past Perfect Continuous</strong>: Describes ongoing actions that were happening before a point in the past (e.g., <em>She had been writing</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Future Perfect Continuous</strong>: Describes actions that will be ongoing up until a certain point in the future (e.g., <em>She will have been writing</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verb Forms</strong> describe the structure of the verb itself, like its base, participles, and conjugations.</li>
<li><strong>Verb Tenses</strong> describe the timing and type of action, providing context for when something happens. </li>
</ul>
<p>The forms are used to create the various tenses and other grammatical structures in a language.</p>
