<li>An IF game where two or more players adopt the roles of multiple PCs simultaneously is referred to as strong multiplayer IF or true multiplayer IF.</li>

<li>To date, there's been very little true multiplayer IF. Some of the problems are:
<ul>
<li><strong>How to put IF and chat together.</strong> Wedding an IF game to any of the available chat environments is not obvious, and most authors would not want to invent their own chat systems -- just writing IF can be challenging enough!</li>
<li><strong>Multiple output text streams.</strong> True multiplayer IF must display different text to different players. They shouldn't all see the same thing when they're playing different characters within the game.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplayer puzzle design.</strong> Many standard IF puzzles can't be used as is in multiplayer games without inviting <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/Deadlock" title="Deadlock">deadlock</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Getting people to play it.</strong> Getting IF players together at the same time can itself be a challenge, especially when they are accustomed to playing solo.</li>
