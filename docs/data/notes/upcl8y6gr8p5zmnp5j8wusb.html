<p><a href="/notes/wtr8mkilwzti5y5o9jp03dm">@chatgpt.4o</a>:</p>
<p>"Fabulary" and "Fabularia" are two variations that maintain the essence of "fabula" while offering slightly different connotations:</p>
<h3 id="fabulary">Fabulary:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#fabulary"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connotation</strong>: "Fabulary" suggests a more compact or structured collection of events. The suffix "-ary" often implies a collection or something akin to a library (e.g., "glossary," "dictionary"). Thus, "fabulary" could evoke the idea of a structured, perhaps even indexed, collection of narrative events.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: It might be used to describe a systematic catalog or organized record of the events in a story, potentially emphasizing their organization or categorization.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fabularia">Fabularia:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#fabularia"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connotation</strong>: "Fabularia" has a more expansive and perhaps formal tone. The suffix "-aria" can give the word a sense of being more elaborate or grand, possibly hinting at a comprehensive collection or even a domain of events within a narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: This term might be used to suggest a more extensive or rich compendium of events, one that encompasses the full range of narrative possibilities or a detailed chronicle of a story's events.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="comparison">Comparison:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#comparison"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scope</strong>: "Fabularia" feels broader and more expansive, suggesting a richer or more detailed collection, while "Fabulary" feels more focused, structured, or systematic.</li>
<li><strong>Formality</strong>: "Fabularia" might be perceived as more formal or grandiose, whereas "Fabulary" might be seen as more practical or utilitarian.</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong>: "Fabularia" could be more suited for use in contexts where you want to emphasize the depth or richness of the narrative chronicle, while "Fabulary" might be better for contexts that emphasize structure, order, or organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fabulary</strong>: A structured, organized collection of narrative events, with a focus on systematic presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Fabularia</strong>: A more expansive, possibly more formal or grand, compendium of narrative events, suggesting richness and depth. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your choice between the two would depend on the tone and scope you wish to convey in your project.</p>
<h2 id="fabula-is-just-another-narrative">fabula is just another narrative<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#fabula-is-just-another-narrative"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/X5I3NCsQt0FQDQ4r0ddk4">@dave</a>: Regarding Fabula, isn't the fabula just another narrative that happens to be in chronologic order? Is the idea that the fabula includes "every relevant event" to a narrative? It makes sense to me to see the fabula as a narration as well, maybe just a special one that is more complete and chornological. But maybe fabula is supposed to be abstract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/wtr8mkilwzti5y5o9jp03dm">@chatgpt.4o</a>: You're touching on a nuanced and important aspect of the concept of <strong>fabula</strong> in narratology. The distinction between <strong>fabula</strong> and <strong>sjuzhet</strong> (or syuzhet) is central to understanding how narratives are structured and understood.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fabula-vs-sjuzhet">Fabula vs. Sjuzhet:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#fabula-vs-sjuzhet"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fabula</strong>: The fabula refers to the raw material of the story—the chronological sequence of events as they would occur in the "real world" of the story, without any narrative manipulation. It’s the "what happened" in its most basic form, listing all relevant events in the order they occur within the story’s universe.</li>
<li><strong>Sjuzhet</strong>: The sjuzhet, on the other hand, refers to the specific way the fabula is presented in the narrative. This includes the order in which events are told, the pacing, and any narrative techniques like flashbacks, foreshadowing, or other forms of temporal manipulation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="is-the-fabula-just-another-narrative">Is the Fabula Just Another Narrative?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#is-the-fabula-just-another-narrative"></a></h3>
<p>In a sense, you could consider the fabula as a kind of narrative, but it’s a narrative in its most raw and abstract form. Here’s how that breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chronological Order</strong>: The fabula is often thought of as being in chronological order because it represents the "real" sequence of events. However, it is not itself a narrative that has been told; rather, it’s a conceptual abstraction of the narrative’s events arranged in a logical, causal sequence. It’s the underlying story that exists before any narrative manipulation occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inclusion of All Relevant Events</strong>: Yes, the fabula includes every relevant event necessary to understand the story. This includes events that may not be explicitly narrated in the sjuzhet but are implied or necessary for the coherence of the story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Narration vs. Abstract Representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrative Aspect</strong>: In some ways, you can think of the fabula as a "narrative" because it involves the arrangement of events in a sequence. However, it’s more accurate to think of it as an abstract representation of the story’s content, devoid of the narrative techniques and manipulations that are part of the sjuzhet.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract Nature</strong>: The fabula is meant to be an abstract concept rather than a concrete narrative. It represents the logical structure of events and actions that form the basis of any narrative but is not itself "told" in the same way a narrative is. The sjuzhet is the actual telling, with all its stylistic choices and deviations from the chronological order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="special-case-of-fabula">Special Case of Fabula:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#special-case-of-fabula"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>More Complete and Chronological</strong>: When you refer to the fabula as being "more complete and chronological," that’s correct in the sense that it includes all the events that make up the story’s raw material, arranged in the order they actually occur. However, it remains an abstract construct, not a narrated version of the story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fabula as Abstract</strong>: The fabula is intended to be an abstract concept, a tool for analyzing the underlying structure of narratives. It’s not meant to be a narrative in itself but rather the blueprint from which a narrative can be constructed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>fabula</strong> is not just another narrative but rather the abstract sequence of events that underlies any narrative. It includes all relevant events in their logical, chronological order, serving as the raw material from which the actual narrative (sjuzhet) is constructed. While you could conceptually narrate the fabula, in narratology, it remains an abstract concept that helps distinguish between the story’s content and its presentation.</p>
<h2 id="sjuzhets-determine-fabula">sjuzhets determine fabula<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#sjuzhets-determine-fabula"></a></h2>
<p>dave: I'm trying to apply the concepts of fabula and sjuzhet to my role-playing experience platform. I think of the fabula as some subset of the "events" that happen in a role-playing session. Issues include: is the role-playing session actually a special kind of narration that indirectly generates the fabula? how do you draw the line between events that are irrelevant (like "Gunaar checked his inventory and discarded the lute") and events that might be relevant to a re-telling or adaptation? i.e., you can't know in advance what constitutes the fabula, which is another way of saying, the sjuzhets determine the fabula.</p>
<p>chatgpt.4o: You're delving into a fascinating application of the concepts of <strong>fabula</strong> and <strong>sjuzhet</strong> to your role-playing experience platform. Let's explore how these concepts might apply and address the issues you're encountering.</p>
<h3 id="role-playing-session-as-a-form-of-narration">Role-Playing Session as a Form of Narration:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#role-playing-session-as-a-form-of-narration"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is the Role-Playing Session a Narration?</strong>: A role-playing session can indeed be viewed as a form of live, collaborative narration. Players and the game master (GM) collaboratively create a story in real-time. In this context, the session itself could be seen as generating the <strong>sjuzhet</strong>—the specific narrative as it unfolds, complete with the players' choices, dialogue, and actions.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Generation of Fabula</strong>: The fabula, in this case, might be seen as a subset of the events that emerge from this sjuzhet. However, it's an abstraction that isn't fully determined until the narrative is later reconstructed or retold. The fabula could be considered the logical, chronological sequence of "significant" events that would be identified if you were to retell the story after the session.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="determining-relevance-fabula-vs-irrelevant-events">Determining Relevance: Fabula vs. Irrelevant Events:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#determining-relevance-fabula-vs-irrelevant-events"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drawing the Line Between Relevant and Irrelevant Events</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Context-Dependent</strong>: The distinction between relevant and irrelevant events is highly context-dependent and can vary depending on the focus or purpose of the retelling. For example, if the story focuses on Gunaar's character development, discarding the lute might be relevant if it symbolizes something important about his choices or personality.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Session Analysis</strong>: You might not always know in advance what constitutes the fabula. Often, it’s only in retrospect, when preparing to retell or adapt the session, that you determine which events were truly significant. This post-session analysis is where the sjuzhet (the narrative as it was played out) informs the fabula (the underlying story structure).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sjuzhet-shaping-fabula">Sjuzhet Shaping Fabula:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#sjuzhet-shaping-fabula"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sjuzhet Determining Fabula</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Iterative Process</strong>: In role-playing, the fabula isn’t fully fixed until the narrative is later recounted, adapted, or analyzed. The sjuzhet generated during the session gives rise to the fabula by highlighting which events were essential to the story. This is an iterative process, where the sjuzhet shapes our understanding of what the fabula is.</li>
<li><strong>Selective Emphasis</strong>: During a retelling, the focus on certain events over others (emphasized by the sjuzhet) essentially defines what the fabula will be. In a sense, the sjuzhet can be seen as retroactively constructing the fabula by determining which events are recounted and in what way.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="practical-application-to-your-platform">Practical Application to Your Platform:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#practical-application-to-your-platform"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Event Logging and Analysis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record All Events</strong>: During the role-playing session, log all events without initially worrying about their relevance. This provides a comprehensive dataset from which the fabula can later be distilled.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Session Tools</strong>: Develop tools that allow users (GMs or players) to review the session and select events that are relevant for a specific retelling or adaptation. These tools could help identify key events that form the fabula for that particular narrative purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptive Storytelling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple Fabulae</strong>: Depending on the narrative goals, different retellings of the same session might produce different fabulae, with different events considered relevant. This flexibility could be a key feature of your platform, allowing for rich, multi-layered storytelling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion-1"></a></h3>
<p>In the context of your role-playing platform, the fabula can be seen as an abstract, context-dependent subset of events derived from the sjuzhet generated during the session. The role-playing session acts as a dynamic, live narration that produces a sjuzhet, which in turn helps determine the fabula during retellings or adaptations. By embracing the iterative and adaptive nature of this process, your platform can offer a powerful tool for creating and refining narratives based on role-playing experiences. </p>
<h2 id="retellings-might-have-different-fabula">retellings might have different fabula<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#retellings-might-have-different-fabula"></a></h2>
<p>dave: another issue is that, since it's fiction anyhow, in a retelling of a session I might add things that didn't happen, or significantly change things that were said, to make the story more consistent or funnier. So I guess that means my retelling has a different fabula?</p>
<p>chatgpt.4o: Yes, if you add or significantly change events in a retelling, this can indeed result in a different <strong>fabula</strong>. Here's why:</p>
<h3 id="altering-the-fabula-through-retelling">Altering the Fabula through Retelling:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#altering-the-fabula-through-retelling"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fabula as an Abstraction</strong>: The fabula is typically seen as the abstract, chronological sequence of events that underpin the narrative. When you modify or add events in a retelling, you're effectively creating a new sequence of events—whether by introducing new occurrences, changing the outcomes of existing events, or altering the characters' actions and dialogue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Fabula Creation</strong>: By altering events in your retelling, you are constructing a different underlying story, which means the fabula of the retelling differs from the fabula of the original session. The original fabula was based on the events as they actually unfolded during the session, while the new fabula reflects the story as you’ve reshaped it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-implications">Practical Implications:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#practical-implications"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Fabulae</strong>: This situation suggests that multiple fabulae can emerge from the same role-playing session, depending on how the events are retold or adapted. Each version of the narrative—whether it sticks closely to the original or introduces significant changes—has its own fabula, defined by the sequence and nature of the events it includes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creative Flexibility</strong>: This flexibility is actually one of the strengths of narrative storytelling, especially in a role-playing context. It allows for creative reinterpretation and refinement, where different versions of the story can emphasize different aspects, introduce new elements, or adjust the tone and focus to better fit the desired outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storytelling Tools</strong>: Your platform could incorporate tools to help users explore these different fabulae, perhaps allowing them to compare the "original" fabula with the altered one, or to track changes and their impact on the narrative. This could be an interesting feature that highlights the fluidity and adaptability of storytelling in role-playing games.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion-2"></a></h3>
<p>In summary, when you change or add events in a retelling, you are indeed creating a different fabula. This underscores the dynamic nature of storytelling, where the same session can give rise to multiple, distinct narratives, each with its own underlying structure of events. Your platform can embrace this multiplicity, allowing users to craft and explore various interpretations and versions of their stories.</p>
<h2 id="blurring-of-sjuzhet-and-fabula">blurring of sjuzhet and fabula<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#blurring-of-sjuzhet-and-fabula"></a></h2>
<p>dave: Or perhaps if the story is just retold from a different character's perspective (or a different narrator's perspective) it's the same fabula, but just interpreted (or willfully misinterpreted) in ways that diverge from the "actual" events. There's a lot of events the characters and players don't see in a role-playing session, for example. I'm seeing a lot of blurring between fabula an sjuzhet, or at least difficulty applying it in cases where "all the events" aren't fully specified. </p>
<p>chatgpt.4o: You're touching on a key challenge when applying the concepts of <strong>fabula</strong> and <strong>sjuzhet</strong> to dynamic and interactive storytelling, such as in role-playing games. The blurring between these concepts is especially pronounced in cases where not all events are explicitly known or witnessed by the characters or players.</p>
<h3 id="fabula-and-sjuzhet-in-context">Fabula and Sjuzhet in Context:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#fabula-and-sjuzhet-in-context"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Same Fabula, Different Perspectives</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the story is retold from a different character's or narrator's perspective, the fabula could indeed remain the same in the sense that the underlying sequence of events—the "reality" of the narrative world—doesn't change. However, the <strong>sjuzhet</strong> changes significantly because the way those events are presented, interpreted, or even willfully misinterpreted differs depending on the narrator's viewpoint.</li>
<li>For example, two characters might experience the same event but interpret it very differently, leading to two divergent narrations (sjuzhets) of the same fabula.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unseen Events</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a role-playing session, there are often events that characters or players don't see or know about, which complicates the fabula-sjuzhet distinction. If the fabula is supposed to represent "all relevant events," but some events are unknown or unspecified, it raises questions about how complete the fabula really is.</li>
<li>When a story is retold with new information or from a different perspective that includes previously unseen events, it challenges the idea that the fabula is fixed and fully knowable. This can blur the line between fabula and sjuzhet because what is considered part of the "actual" sequence of events may change as new information comes to light.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="addressing-the-blurring">Addressing the Blurring:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#addressing-the-blurring"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexible Fabula</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One approach is to think of the fabula as more fluid, capable of evolving as new events are discovered or as perspectives shift. In this view, the fabula is not entirely distinct from the sjuzhet but is shaped and redefined by the process of narration and reinterpretation.</li>
<li>This flexibility could be a feature of your platform, allowing users to expand or revise the fabula as they explore different narrations or uncover new events in subsequent sessions or retellings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Fabulae or Partial Fabula</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might also consider that there can be multiple fabulae for a single role-playing session, each corresponding to different interpretations or narrative goals. Alternatively, you could work with the concept of a "partial fabula," where the fabula is an incomplete but evolving representation of the story's events, refined over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-3">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion-3"></a></h3>
<p>The blurring between fabula and sjuzhet is natural, especially in the context of role-playing games where not all events are known, and different perspectives can alter the narrative. The fabula can be seen as a flexible, evolving construct rather than a fixed, fully defined sequence of events. This approach allows for a richer, more dynamic interaction between narrative and storytelling, where the boundaries between fabula and sjuzhet are porous and adaptable to different storytelling needs. Your platform could embrace this fluidity, offering tools for exploring and revising both the fabula and sjuzhet as the story evolves.</p>
