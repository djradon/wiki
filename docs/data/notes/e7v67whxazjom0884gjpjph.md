## Issues


- The game holds out the promise of characters advancing into truly epic levels of power — founding kingdoms in AD&D, becoming literal gods in Basic D&D, the Epic Level Handbook in 3rd Edition, the Paragon and Epic tiers of 4th Edition — but a significant portion of the fanbase has mostly been interested in playing Aragorn and Conan

## Possible Solution

- Eliminate all of those high-level abilities that shred dungeons and low-level structures of play
