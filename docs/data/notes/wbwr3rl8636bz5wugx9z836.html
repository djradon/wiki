<li>The unofficial publicist of the new humanist movement, Foerster specialized in the manifesto. In 1929, he published American Scholar, in which he argued that literature should not serve to inspire, as Emerson had it, but as a record of “the strivings of Mankind to know and express itself.</li>
<li>Stegner hated the social novel as much as Babbitt had, advising his students that their ideas should live in “the attic” of their writing and show themselves at most “like ghosts flitting past the windows after dark.”</li>
<li>The old new humanist principles of self-knowledge (write what you know) and self-discipline (show, don’t tell) found a home in the creative writing workshop and, as Engle’s and Stegner’s students went off to form their own programs, turned into common sense.</li>
<li>In 1930, Lewis worried about an “American fear of literature” — of readers who didn’t want to grapple with social novels and the issues they raised. Ninety years later, we should worry about why we stopped fearing it.</li>
