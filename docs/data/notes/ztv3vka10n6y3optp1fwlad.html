<li>"Let's say we have a sentence "The sky is blue" and now, 2 people work on this document. A adds "Today" at the beginning, and the other adds "like the sea" at the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>How are we supposed to represent this in git? Making a commit for each of them? That would result in hundreds of commits within a few minutes for 2 or 3 people working on a document, and none of them would make sense. Also what to put there as a commit message?</p>
<p>Or should we record the changes of each user for 5 minutes and then make a commit? That doesn't work. Git would break in a merge conflict here, which is not properly resolvable. Well, might by using some force towards the final document we already recorded in CodiMD? Maybe, but I foresee a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>So far, I consider real-time collaboration using OT and git diffs as not workable together. Exports and imports, yes. As real backend for the document storage, no.</p>
<p>Not to mention the problem of "how do organize this repository-wise?". One repository per user? One repository per document? One repository per instance? Or do we introduce collections first, which are repositories which then hold the documents? Are they read-only or do we let other people push things there? How do we merge those pushes with the real-time editing?</p>
<p>Git is simply not made for real-time collaboration. And CodiMD is exactly that in first place: A real-time-collaboration tool for markdown."</p>
