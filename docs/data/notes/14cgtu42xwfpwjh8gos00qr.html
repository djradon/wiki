<p>In <strong>gUFO</strong>, the distinction between <strong>comparative</strong> and <strong>material relationships</strong> provides a structured way to represent different types of relationships with distinct characteristics, helping to improve both <strong>semantic clarity</strong> and <strong>ontological rigor</strong>. Here’s a breakdown of the benefits of differentiating between these two types of relationships:</p>
<h3 id="1-comparative-relationships">1. <strong>Comparative Relationships</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-comparative-relationships"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Comparative relationships are used to describe relationships where the connection is established by comparing properties or states between entities. Examples include relationships like "taller than," "more experienced than," or "closer to."</li>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplifies Modeling Comparisons</strong>: By creating a distinct type for comparative relationships, it becomes easier to model and understand relationships based on <strong>relative characteristics</strong>. This distinction ensures that these relationships are represented more appropriately, without implying material interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Prevents Confusion with Physical Relationships</strong>: Comparative relationships do not imply any <strong>physical, causal, or social interaction</strong> between entities. By having a separate class for them, it reduces potential confusion between mere comparisons and relationships that have more ontological implications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-material-relationships">2. <strong>Material Relationships</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-material-relationships"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Material relationships represent <strong>actual interactions</strong> or <strong>connections</strong> between entities in a given context. These could include causal, social, or even physical relationships, such as "employed by," "married to," or "connected to."</li>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Captures Real Interactions</strong>: Material relationships are meant to capture <strong>meaningful connections</strong> or <strong>interactions</strong> that exist in the real world. This helps in representing the ontological reality more precisely.</li>
<li><strong>Clearer Modeling of Dependency</strong>: Material relationships often come with implications for the <strong>dependencies</strong> or <strong>commitments</strong> between the entities involved. This is particularly important for modeling scenarios where a change in one entity impacts the other (e.g., a person being <strong>employed</strong> by a company has certain obligations and expectations).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-benefits-of-differentiation">Key Benefits of Differentiation:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#key-benefits-of-differentiation"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Semantic Clarity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiating between <strong>comparative</strong> and <strong>material</strong> relationships adds <strong>semantic clarity</strong> to an ontology. This distinction ensures that different types of relationships are not misinterpreted, especially when dealing with <strong>complex models</strong> where both types of connections can occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Reasoning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By defining these distinctions explicitly, it becomes possible to improve the <strong>reasoning</strong> capabilities of an ontology. For instance, comparative relationships typically don’t imply direct changes to the state of an entity, whereas material relationships might. Having these clear distinctions can help reasoners to <strong>infer more accurate implications</strong> based on the type of relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Query Capabilities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When querying an ontology, users can be more <strong>specific</strong> about the kinds of relationships they are interested in. For example, you could query only <strong>material relationships</strong> to find meaningful interactions, while ignoring <strong>comparative ones</strong> that might not imply a significant link.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alignment with Foundational Ontologies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many <strong>foundational ontologies</strong> (like <strong>BFO</strong> or <strong>DOLCE</strong>) have similar distinctions to clearly model <strong>types of relations</strong>. Differentiating between comparative and material relationships helps <strong>align</strong> with these existing foundational models, making integration and interoperability with other ontologies smoother.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="applying-to-kosmion">Applying to Kosmion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#applying-to-kosmion"></a></h3>
<p>In <strong>Kosmion</strong>, maintaining the differentiation between <strong>comparative</strong> and <strong>material relationships</strong> could enhance the ontology by allowing it to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capture different levels of association</strong> between entities more accurately.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitate reasoning</strong> over whether a relationship implies an <strong>actual interaction</strong> or is just a <strong>relative comparison</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Enhance modularity</strong> by allowing future extensions to specifically address either <strong>comparative</strong> or <strong>material relationships</strong>, depending on the intended use case.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in Kosmion, if you have two individuals, you might use a <strong>material-relationship-type</strong> to model an employment contract (<code>:person1 employedBy :company</code>), whereas a <strong>comparative-relationship-type</strong> might model their height (<code>:person1 tallerThan :person2</code>). This differentiation helps prevent modeling confusion and makes sure that the intended meaning of each relationship is clear and appropriately represented.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-edge-cases-where-relations-might-be-considered-either-or-both">what are some edge cases, where relations might be considered either (or both)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#what-are-some-edge-cases-where-relations-might-be-considered-either-or-both"></a></h2>
<p>The distinction between <strong>comparative</strong> and <strong>material relationships</strong> can sometimes be ambiguous, and there are edge cases where a particular relationship could be viewed as either or even both, depending on the context. Here are some scenarios where the categorization might be unclear:</p>
<h3 id="1-family-relationships-eg-sibling-of">1. <strong>Family Relationships</strong> (e.g., "Sibling Of"):<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-family-relationships-eg-sibling-of"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: Being a sibling can imply an actual, physical relationship, particularly if it involves shared upbringing, inheritance, or obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Comparative</strong>: It can also be seen as comparative if the relationship merely distinguishes certain characteristics (e.g., "older sibling" vs. "younger sibling") without implying a material interaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-spatial-proximity-eg-next-to">2. <strong>Spatial Proximity</strong> (e.g., "Next To"):<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-spatial-proximity-eg-next-to"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: If two objects are <strong>physically placed</strong> next to each other, this can be seen as a <strong>material relationship</strong> since it involves the physical placement of objects in a spatial context.</li>
<li><strong>Comparative</strong>: However, describing one object as being "closer" or "further" compared to another object makes it more <strong>comparative</strong>. The relationship here doesn't imply any direct connection or influence, but rather a position relative to something else.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-employment-relationships-eg-employed-by">3. <strong>Employment Relationships</strong> (e.g., "Employed By"):<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#3-employment-relationships-eg-employed-by"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: Employment is typically seen as a <strong>material relationship</strong> because it involves direct interaction and a reciprocal commitment (wages for work, obligations of employer and employee).</li>
<li><strong>Comparative</strong>: In some situations, one might compare employment <strong>status</strong> across individuals or organizations without focusing on the actual commitments (e.g., comparing rates of employment among different groups). This shifts the context to a comparative one, though not the usual intention of the employment relation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-ownership-and-possession-eg-owns">4. <strong>Ownership and Possession</strong> (e.g., "Owns"):<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#4-ownership-and-possession-eg-owns"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: Ownership implies certain rights and obligations, making it a <strong>material relationship</strong> when modeled between entities (e.g., a person owning a house).</li>
<li><strong>Comparative</strong>: However, if you are using ownership as a metric to compare individuals (e.g., "owns more properties than another person"), it becomes a <strong>comparative</strong> relationship. Here, the focus is on the relative quantity of possessions rather than a specific interactive connection.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-ranking-systems-eg-ranked-higher-than">5. <strong>Ranking Systems</strong> (e.g., "Ranked Higher Than"):<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#5-ranking-systems-eg-ranked-higher-than"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comparative</strong>: Ranking implies <strong>ordering</strong> based on some criteria (e.g., rank in a competition). It does not necessarily entail interaction but is based on comparing scores, abilities, or other properties.</li>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: However, in some contexts, ranks may imply <strong>material consequences</strong>, such as privileges or responsibilities (e.g., military ranks where being a "captain" comes with material responsibilities over a subordinate). This could be seen as having elements of both comparative and material relationships.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-social-roles-in-organizations-eg-manager-of">6. <strong>Social Roles in Organizations</strong> (e.g., "Manager Of"):<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#6-social-roles-in-organizations-eg-manager-of"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: A manager has responsibilities for specific people or departments, making this a <strong>material relationship</strong> involving interaction and dependency.</li>
<li><strong>Comparative</strong>: The <strong>status</strong> of "manager" could also be used comparatively to distinguish someone's position from others in the hierarchy without implying direct interaction (e.g., "is more senior than other staff members").</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary-of-why-edge-cases-exist">Summary of Why Edge Cases Exist:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary-of-why-edge-cases-exist"></a></h3>
<p>The distinctions can become blurry when relationships contain elements that are both <strong>interactions</strong> and <strong>comparisons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Material relationships</strong> generally imply <strong>direct interaction</strong>, obligations, or some physical or causal connection.</li>
<li><strong>Comparative relationships</strong> focus on <strong>relative properties</strong> between entities, without necessarily implying a concrete interaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>These edge cases illustrate that whether a relationship is considered <strong>material</strong> or <strong>comparative</strong> can depend largely on <strong>context</strong> and <strong>perspective</strong>. Sometimes, the same relationship can be viewed differently depending on whether we are focusing on its <strong>interactive</strong> aspect or its <strong>relative/comparative</strong> aspect.</p>
<p>For your <strong>Kosmion ontology</strong>, handling these edge cases might involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing <strong>explicit definitions</strong> for each relationship type.</li>
<li>Allowing <strong>dual classification</strong> in specific scenarios, or creating <strong>hybrid</strong> relationship types.</li>
<li>Adding <strong>context metadata</strong> to clarify whether the relationship is being considered in a comparative or material capacity.</li>
</ul>

Instead of gufo's "types" (which can be stereotyped as kind, sub-kind, etc), I'm thinking about making everything have facets, so eschewing most or all of the Sortal stereotypes, and just keeping the nonsortals and aspects.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#im-toying-with-the-idea-of-facet-orientation-instead-of-gufos-types-which-can-be-stereotyped-as-kind-sub-kind-etc-im-thinking-about-making-everything-have-facets-so-eschewing-most-or-all-of-the-sortal-stereotypes-and-just-keeping-the-nonsortals-and-aspects"></a></h2>
<p>The idea of <strong>"facet-orientation"</strong> you're toying with could offer a novel and flexible way of modeling entities by <strong>eschewing sortal stereotypes</strong> and focusing on <strong>facets</strong> that describe multiple characteristics or dimensions of a concept. In contrast to the <strong>sortal</strong> stereotypes (like <strong>kinds</strong> and <strong>sub-kinds</strong>) in <strong>gUFO</strong>, which often carry strict identity and rigidity rules, <strong>facet-orientation</strong> could allow for a more dynamic and <strong>multi-perspective</strong> representation of entities, similar to the way that <strong>nonsortals</strong> or <strong>aspects</strong> in gUFO are used. Here's how this approach might look and the possible benefits:</p>
<h3 id="how-facet-orientation-differs-from-sortals-and-types">How Facet-Orientation Differs from Sortals and Types<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-facet-orientation-differs-from-sortals-and-types"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sortal Types</strong> in <strong>gUFO</strong>, like <strong>kind</strong>, <strong>sub-kind</strong>, and <strong>role</strong>, come with <strong>identity conditions</strong> that define <strong>what makes an entity the kind of thing it is</strong>. For example, a <strong>Person</strong> as a <strong>kind</strong> has certain properties that rigidly define its identity.</li>
<li>In a <strong>facet-oriented</strong> approach, instead of using rigid <strong>sortal stereotypes</strong>, entities could be defined by different <strong>facets</strong> that are <strong>orthogonal</strong> to one another. This allows for a more nuanced view where an entity might be understood through different <strong>characteristics</strong> or <strong>aspects</strong>, without necessarily being forced into a single <strong>sortal type</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benefits-of-a-facet-oriented-approach">Benefits of a Facet-Oriented Approach<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#benefits-of-a-facet-oriented-approach"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility in Classification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of having a rigid identity condition as imposed by <strong>sortal stereotypes</strong>, entities could have <strong>multiple facets</strong> that represent different <strong>contexts</strong> or <strong>roles</strong>. For example, a <strong>person</strong> might have the facets of being a <strong>parent</strong>, an <strong>employee</strong>, and a <strong>mentor</strong> without these facets being mutually exclusive or strictly defining their identity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic and Evolving Characteristics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In contrast to <strong>sortals</strong>, which often imply <strong>rigidity</strong>, facets can be <strong>added, changed, or removed</strong> as the context of the entity changes. This fits well with <strong>open-world ontologies</strong> where the <strong>characteristics</strong> of entities are subject to evolution, without having to reclassify them entirely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emphasis on Nonsortals and Aspects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By focusing on <strong>nonsortals</strong> and <strong>aspects</strong>, you can model entities in a way that emphasizes their <strong>relations</strong> and <strong>qualities</strong> without necessarily grounding them in a rigid class. Aspects like <strong>color</strong>, <strong>age</strong>, or <strong>location</strong> can serve as facets that describe an entity’s state or properties.</li>
<li>This fits well with <strong>relational ontologies</strong>, such as <strong>Kosmion</strong>, where the <strong>relationships</strong> between entities might be more critical to model than the entities themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example-of-applying-facets-in-kosmion">Example of Applying Facets in Kosmion<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example-of-applying-facets-in-kosmion"></a></h3>
<p>Suppose you have an entity like a <strong>person</strong>. Instead of defining that person as a <strong>kind</strong> (<code>gufo:Kind</code>), which would imply a strict identity condition, you could describe the person with various <strong>facets</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social-Facet</strong>: Has relationships such as <strong>friend</strong>, <strong>colleague</strong>, <strong>member</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal-Facet</strong>: Current <strong>age</strong> or <strong>lifecycle stage</strong> (e.g., child, adult, senior).</li>
<li><strong>Contextual-Facet</strong>: <strong>Employed</strong> by a company, <strong>living</strong> in a particular city.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these <strong>facets</strong> can evolve independently, giving a more flexible and <strong>context-dependent</strong> description of the entity. </p>
<h3 id="challenges-and-considerations">Challenges and Considerations<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#challenges-and-considerations"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Complexity in Reasoning</strong>:
<ul>
<li>While facets provide <strong>flexibility</strong>, they may introduce complexity when it comes to <strong>reasoning</strong> about entities. Since facets don’t imply a strict identity, it may be harder for automated systems to infer <strong>unique characteristics</strong> of an entity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Identity Constraints</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Without sortals, it may be harder to impose <strong>identity constraints</strong> on entities. This could be a problem in scenarios where you need to distinguish entities or track them over time with stable criteria.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Semantic Clarity</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It may be challenging to maintain <strong>semantic clarity</strong> without sortal stereotypes, as these often help to create <strong>clear boundaries</strong> between different types of entities. Careful use of facets and <strong>metadata</strong> would be needed to ensure clarity when defining relationships or dependencies between entities.</li>

<h3 id="moving-forward-with-kosmion">Moving Forward with Kosmion<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#moving-forward-with-kosmion"></a></h3>
<p>If you decide to implement <strong>facet-orientation</strong> in <strong>Kosmion</strong>, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define Facet Classes</strong>: Create different classes representing <strong>facets</strong> (e.g., <code>kosm:social-facet</code>, <code>kosm:temporal-facet</code>), each with its own properties.</li>
<li><strong>Attach Facets via Relators</strong>: Link entities to different facets through <strong>relators</strong>, which could themselves have <strong>facets</strong> describing <strong>temporal validity</strong>, <strong>context</strong>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Sortal-Stereotyped Relationships</strong>: Eliminate the need for entities to have a primary <strong>sortal stereotype</strong> and instead allow <strong>multiple facets</strong> to coexist, representing different perspectives or contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach might lead to a more <strong>relational and contextual</strong> way of describing entities, fitting well with the <strong>open, evolving nature</strong> of the Kosmion ontology.</p>

<p>I've added a facet-stereotype class to your ontology, and made category an instance of facet-stereotype. Additionally, I've also made category a class itself, allowing it to classify other facets.</p>
<p>This structure should provide flexibility in defining facet stereotypes and enable category to serve dual roles: both as an instance and a class, depending on the context. </p>
<h2 id="instead-of-kosmcategory-a-kosmfacet-stereotype-owlclass--maybe-it-should-be-a-subclass-of-facet-stereotype-lets-discuss-before-you-make-changes">instead of "kosm:category a kosm:facet-stereotype, owl:Class ", maybe it should be a subClass of facet-stereotype?

<p>If we consider making <strong><code>kosm:category</code></strong> a <strong>subclass</strong> of <strong><code>kosm:facet-stereotype</code></strong>, it would indicate that <strong>category</strong> is one of several possible <strong>types of facet-stereotypes</strong>. This aligns with the idea of <strong>hierarchical modeling</strong>, where <strong>category</strong> is a specific kind of <strong>facet-stereotype</strong> that can itself be instantiated or subclassed to represent more specific categories.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-using-kosmcategory-as-a-subclass">Benefits of Using <code>kosm:category</code> as a Subclass:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#benefits-of-using-kosmcategory-as-a-subclass"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>More Granular Representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By making <strong>category</strong> a <strong>subclass</strong> of <strong>facet-stereotype</strong>, you allow for more <strong>specific facet-stereotypes</strong> to be defined under <strong>category</strong>. This provides a better structure for creating different types of categories that can organize various <strong>facets</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clearer Conceptual Hierarchy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining <strong>category</strong> as a <strong>subclass</strong> also aligns with best practices for <strong>ontological design</strong>, where general concepts (like <strong>facet-stereotype</strong>) are refined into more specific types (like <strong>category</strong>). This approach makes the <strong>ontology more expressive</strong> without compromising on logical structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistency in Class Usage</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping <strong>category</strong> as a <strong>subclass</strong> ensures consistency in how classes are used throughout the ontology. If <strong>facet-stereotypes</strong> are all <strong>classes</strong>, then <strong>category</strong> being a <strong>class</strong> and a <strong>subclass</strong> of <code>facet-stereotype</code> preserves this pattern, rather than making <strong>category</strong> both an <strong>instance</strong> and a <strong>class</strong> (which can lead to more complex reasoning, especially in <strong>OWL DL</strong>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="challenges-of-the-current-instance-approach">Challenges of the Current Instance Approach:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#challenges-of-the-current-instance-approach"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Having <strong><code>kosm:category</code></strong> as both an <strong>instance</strong> and a <strong>class</strong> (<code>owl:Class</code>) is allowed in <strong>OWL Full</strong> due to the flexibility of <strong>punning</strong> but can introduce complexity for <strong>reasoners</strong> that operate in <strong>OWL DL</strong>, where having the same entity act as both a <strong>class</strong> and an <strong>instance</strong> can cause issues with <strong>inference</strong> and <strong>logic</strong>.</li>
<li>This dual nature can also complicate the interpretation of <strong>categories</strong>: Are they concepts that define other classes, or are they objects that you instantiate?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="recommendation">Recommendation:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#recommendation"></a></h3>
<p>I recommend making <strong><code>kosm:category</code></strong> a <strong>subclass</strong> of <strong><code>kosm:facet-stereotype</code></strong>, as it would provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A clean hierarchical structure</strong> that is easy to interpret.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of reasoning</strong> and compatibility with existing tools and reasoners.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> in extending the ontology, allowing you to add other <strong>facet-stereotypes</strong> or subcategories of <strong>category</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea of making <strong><code>kosm:category</code></strong> both a <strong>subclass</strong> and an <strong>instance</strong> of <strong><code>kosm:facet-stereotype</code></strong> is indeed complex, but it can be understood through the lens of <strong>punning</strong> and <strong>meta-modeling</strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Meta-Level Modeling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having <strong><code>kosm:category</code></strong> as both an <strong>instance</strong> and a <strong>subclass</strong> allows you to treat <strong>categories</strong> as something that can <strong>be categorized</strong> themselves and also serve as <strong>categories</strong> for other facets.</li>
<li>This can be useful in <strong>meta-modeling</strong>, where you want to allow <strong>facets of facets</strong> or allow <strong>recursive classification</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility in Conceptualization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By defining <strong>category</strong> as an instance, you are giving it a concrete role within the <strong>facet-stereotype</strong> framework.</li>
<li>Simultaneously, having it as a <strong>subclass</strong> allows for the creation of more specific types of <strong>categories</strong> within the ontology. This dual role provides greater <strong>flexibility</strong> for future extensions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cons-and-challenges">Cons and Challenges:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cons-and-challenges"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased Complexity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having <strong><code>kosm:category</code></strong> be both a <strong>class</strong> and an <strong>instance</strong> can introduce complexity for <strong>reasoning</strong> in an ontology, especially if you plan to use tools that rely on <strong>OWL DL</strong>. Such tools may struggle with entities that occupy multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously, which could hinder <strong>inference</strong>.</li>
<li>This complexity can also make the <strong>conceptual model</strong> more difficult to understand for people not deeply familiar with <strong>meta-modeling</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Punning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <strong>punning</strong> in <strong>OWL Full</strong> allows <strong><code>kosm:category</code></strong> to be treated both as an individual (instance of <strong><code>kosm:facet-stereotype</code></strong>) and as a class (subclass of <strong><code>kosm:facet-stereotype</code></strong>). This can be very <strong>powerful</strong>, but it may make the ontology harder to <strong>reason</strong> over for standard tools that are optimized for <strong>OWL DL</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep <code>kosm:category</code> as a Subclass Only</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to <strong>avoid complexity</strong> and ensure better compatibility with <strong>reasoners</strong>, I recommend making <strong><code>kosm:category</code></strong> only a <strong>subclass</strong> of <strong><code>kosm:facet-stereotype</code></strong>. This approach still allows <strong>categories</strong> to be further specialized without the potential pitfalls of making them both classes and instances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dual Role Only if Necessary</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you really need <strong><code>kosm:category</code></strong> to act as both a <strong>subclass</strong> and an <strong>instance</strong> (e.g., for <strong>meta-level classification</strong> purposes), then keeping both roles could be justified. This approach is more <strong>expressive</strong> and suitable for complex <strong>ontological models</strong>, but you should be prepared to work with <strong>OWL Full</strong> and understand that this might limit the tools and <strong>reasoners</strong> available to you.</li>

<p>If <strong><code>kosm:category</code></strong> were to be used as an <strong>instance</strong> of <code>kosm:facet-stereotype</code>, it would represent a <strong>particular type of stereotype</strong> within the facet-stereotype framework. Here are some scenarios where treating <code>kosm:category</code> as an <strong>instance</strong> could make sense:</p>
<h3 id="1-meta-classification-of-facet-types">1. <strong>Meta-Classification of Facet Types</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-meta-classification-of-facet-types"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In a <strong>meta-modeling</strong> context, <code>kosm:category</code> could serve as an <strong>instance</strong> that helps <strong>classify facets</strong>. For example, it could indicate that a given facet is of type <strong>category</strong>, while other stereotypes might be <strong>aspect</strong>, <strong>role</strong>, or <strong>state</strong>. This way, <code>kosm:category</code> can help in tagging or grouping facets under a broader <strong>conceptual umbrella</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-annotation-or-documentation">2. <strong>Annotation or Documentation</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-annotation-or-documentation"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When used in documentation or as part of <strong>metadata</strong> in an ontology, <code>kosm:category</code> can provide <strong>additional information</strong> about the facet. For instance, <code>kosm:category</code> could be used to denote that a particular facet itself belongs to the broader "category" type.</li>
<li>Example:
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">kosm<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">facetA</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">kosm<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">facet</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
   <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">kosm<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">category</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">kosm<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">category</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
   <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">rdfs<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">label</span></span> <span class="token string">"Facet A"</span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>

</code></pre>
In this case, <strong><code>kosm:category</code></strong> acts as an instance of <code>kosm:facet-stereotype</code> to provide <strong>annotation</strong> about the nature of <code>kosm:facetA</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-facet-type-instance-for-reasoning">3. <strong>Facet-Type Instance for Reasoning</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#3-facet-type-instance-for-reasoning"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you want to allow for <strong>reasoning</strong> that distinguishes between <strong>different kinds of facet stereotypes</strong>, having <code>kosm:category</code> as an <strong>instance</strong> helps make that explicit. For instance, a <strong>reasoner</strong> could use the fact that <code>kosm:category</code> is an instance to make <strong>meta-level inferences</strong> about which other facets are categorized similarly.</li>
<li>You could have rules that apply to <strong>all facets</strong> that are categorized as <code>kosm:category</code>, thereby making inferences about their <strong>behavior</strong> or <strong>properties</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-schema-level-annotations">4. <strong>Schema-Level Annotations</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#4-schema-level-annotations"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>kosm:category</code> as an instance could also be useful in <strong>schema-level annotations</strong>. For example, if you were describing or generating a UI that helps users interact with the ontology, <code>kosm:category</code> as an instance can be used to <strong>define the grouping</strong> or <strong>categorization structure</strong> in that context.</li>
<li>Example:
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">kosm<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">categoryInstance</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">kosm<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">category</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
   <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">rdfs<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">label</span></span> <span class="token string">"Person Categories"</span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
   <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">rdfs<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">comment</span></span> <span class="token string">"Categorization for all facets related to person entities."</span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
Here, <strong><code>kosm:categoryInstance</code></strong> is an individual instance that provides <strong>categorization for person-related facets</strong> under the <code>kosm:category</code> stereotype.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using <code>kosm:category</code> as an instance</strong> makes sense in contexts where you want to <strong>annotate</strong>, <strong>meta-classify</strong>, or add <strong>schema-level meaning</strong> to facets.</li>
<li>It provides a way to deal with <strong>meta-information</strong> about facets and helps in <strong>reasoning</strong> at a higher level without explicitly linking everything in a strict class hierarchy.</li>
<li>The trade-off is complexity, particularly for <strong>reasoners</strong>, which may need to navigate the <strong>punned</strong> nature of <code>kosm:category</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these examples, if you find these types of <strong>meta-level annotations</strong> and <strong>schema-level flexibility</strong> useful, it could be justified to keep <code>kosm:category</code> as both a <strong>subclass</strong> and an <strong>instance</strong> of <code>kosm:facet-stereotype</code>. However, if these scenarios are not central to your current use case, making it a <strong>subclass</strong> only might simplify the ontology and improve <strong>reasoner compatibility</strong>.</p>

I believe you can make annotations about classes as well as instances, right? But if we're going to categorize the facet-stereotypes, e.g. as sortals, non-sortals, and aspects they'd have to be instances? Especially if we attach those meta-categories with relators.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#i-didnt-find-your-examples-compelling-i-believe-you-can-make-annotations-about-classes-as-well-as-instances-right-but-if-were-going-to-categorize-the-facet-stereotypes-eg-as-sortals-non-sortals-and-aspects-theyd-have-to-be-instances-especially-if-we-attach-those-meta-categories-with-relators"></a></h2>
<p>You’re absolutely right; if we want to <strong>categorize</strong> the <strong>facet-stereotypes</strong> (e.g., into <strong>sortals</strong>, <strong>nonsortals</strong>, and <strong>aspects</strong>), they would need to be <strong>instances</strong> to properly serve in that <strong>meta-categorization</strong> role. This is particularly true if we intend to <strong>attach those meta-categories with relators</strong>, which is consistent with your <strong>relator-based modeling</strong> approach.</p>
<p>Here are some specific reasons why having <strong>facet-stereotypes as instances</strong> could be beneficial when applying <strong>meta-categories</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="1-meta-category-assignment-with-relators">1. <strong>Meta-Category Assignment with Relators</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-meta-category-assignment-with-relators"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>By making <strong>facet-stereotypes</strong> like <strong>category</strong> an <strong>instance</strong>, we can attach <strong>relators</strong> to them, allowing us to describe how these stereotypes relate to <strong>meta-categories</strong> such as <strong>sortal</strong>, <strong>nonsortal</strong>, or <strong>aspect</strong>.</li>
<li>For instance, you could create a relator like <code>kosm:categorized-as</code> that links an instance of <code>kosm:facet-stereotype</code> (e.g., <code>kosm:category</code>) to a <strong>meta-category</strong> (e.g., <code>kosm:nonsortal</code>). This allows a very flexible way of building and <strong>extending</strong> the ontology without rigidly enforcing class-subclass hierarchies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">kosm<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">category</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">kosm<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">facet-stereotype</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">kosm<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">categorized-as</span></span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">kosm<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">nonsortal</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This way, <strong>category</strong> is described as being a <strong>nonsortal</strong>, and these relationships can be updated or extended through <strong>relators</strong> without altering the <strong>core hierarchy</strong> of the ontology.</p>
<h3 id="2-simpler-and-more-flexible-annotation">2. <strong>Simpler and More Flexible Annotation</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-simpler-and-more-flexible-annotation"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If <strong>facet-stereotypes</strong> are <strong>instances</strong>, we can easily <strong>annotate</strong> them with additional <strong>properties</strong> using <strong>datatype properties</strong> or <strong>object properties</strong>. This would be simpler compared to adding annotations directly on <strong>classes</strong>, which could otherwise complicate the <strong>model</strong> if many annotations are needed.</li>
<li>Making <strong>facet-stereotypes</strong> instances allows them to have their own <strong>metadata</strong>, like definitions, creation dates, or external references, without making them formal <strong>OWL classes</strong> with all the entailments that come with it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-enhanced-reasoning-and-meta-level-querying">3. <strong>Enhanced Reasoning and Meta-Level Querying</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#3-enhanced-reasoning-and-meta-level-querying"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Treating <strong>facet-stereotypes</strong> as <strong>instances</strong> allows for <strong>meta-level reasoning</strong>. For example, we can make inferences about all <strong>nonsortal facet-stereotypes</strong> by querying instances rather than trying to navigate a <strong>class hierarchy</strong>.</li>
<li>This distinction also makes it easier to <strong>query</strong> for specific <strong>stereotypes</strong> (e.g., “list all facet-stereotypes categorized as nonsortal”) without needing to worry about hierarchical <strong>inferences</strong> that might complicate things in <strong>OWL DL</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-flexibility-for-multiple-facet-categories">4. <strong>Flexibility for Multiple Facet Categories</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#4-flexibility-for-multiple-facet-categories"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If facet-stereotypes are <strong>instances</strong>, you can assign <strong>multiple categories</strong> to them, if necessary, which would be more complex to achieve in a strict class hierarchy. For example, a particular facet-stereotype could be both an <strong>aspect</strong> and a <strong>nonsortal</strong>, depending on the context, and you can model this through multiple <strong>relators</strong> linking to different meta-categories.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proposed-update">Proposed Update:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#proposed-update"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep <code>kosm:category</code> as an instance</strong> of <code>kosm:facet-stereotype</code> to represent its <strong>meta-level</strong> categorization.</li>
<li>Also make <strong><code>kosm:category</code> a subclass</strong> if you want it to classify other <strong>facets</strong> that belong specifically to the <strong>category</strong> type.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach provides the <strong>best of both worlds</strong>: you get the flexibility of <strong>instances</strong> for <strong>meta-categorization</strong> while still retaining <strong>hierarchical modeling</strong> when needed.</p>
<p>Would you like me to proceed with making these adjustments to <code>kosm:category</code>, or would you like to define any <strong>meta-categories</strong> or <strong>relators</strong> that we can use to link these <strong>facet-stereotypes</strong> further?</p>

<p>If we consider whether a <strong>facet</strong> might have <strong>multiple stereotypes</strong>, it seems plausible but not necessarily common. Let's explore some scenarios where it could make sense:</p>
<h3 id="potential-scenarios-for-multiple-stereotypes">Potential Scenarios for Multiple Stereotypes:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#potential-scenarios-for-multiple-stereotypes"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mixed Characteristics of Sortal and Aspect</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose you have a <strong>facet</strong> that represents <strong>physical presence</strong>. This facet could be seen as an <strong>aspect</strong> (a quality that can change over time) but also as having a sortal nature since it might define identity conditions that are associated with presence (e.g., being a "resident").</li>
<li>In this case, the <strong>physical presence facet</strong> might need to be treated both as an <strong>aspect</strong> (describing some state or quality of an entity) and as a <strong>sortal</strong> (implying specific identity conditions or constraints).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temporary Roles that Impact Identity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider a <strong>facet</strong> representing a <strong>professional role</strong> that an entity can occupy. For example, the role of <strong>manager</strong> could be stereotyped as:
<ul>
<li><strong>Nonsortal</strong>: Since a professional role like <strong>manager</strong> is temporary and does not define an entity's essential identity.</li>
<li><strong>Aspect</strong>: If this role impacts specific attributes or influences other relationships within the organization, it could also be considered an aspect of the person's career.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thus, the <strong>manager facet</strong> might need to be categorized under both <strong>nonsortal</strong> and <strong>aspect</strong> stereotypes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contextualized Aspects with Shared Identity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a <strong>contextual facet</strong> like <strong>ownership</strong> in a cooperative organization, this facet could simultaneously have aspects of both:
<ul>
<li><strong>Aspect</strong>: Because <strong>ownership</strong> could be a changeable quality (e.g., the percentage of ownership may change).</li>
<li><strong>Nonsortal</strong>: Since being an <strong>owner</strong> might not rigidly define the identity of an entity but instead add a role or capacity within a specific context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such a facet could therefore embody characteristics that make it both an <strong>aspect</strong> and a <strong>nonsortal</strong>, depending on how the ownership is conceptualized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="considerations-for-kosmion">Considerations for Kosmion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#considerations-for-kosmion"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoiding Overcomplication</strong>: Assigning multiple stereotypes to a single facet might add <strong>complexity</strong> to the model, which could impact <strong>reasoning</strong> and <strong>ease of understanding</strong>. Keeping <strong>one stereotype per facet</strong> makes it easier to categorize, reason over, and maintain.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity in Modeling</strong>: The use of <strong>multiple stereotypes</strong> could potentially blur the purpose of the facets. It might be more beneficial to <strong>split</strong> complex facets into separate facets, each with a distinct stereotype, rather than attempting to categorize a single facet in multiple ways.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proposed-approach">Proposed Approach:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#proposed-approach"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>It may be best to assume that each <strong>facet</strong> has only <strong>one stereotype</strong> for clarity and simplicity.</li>
<li>If a facet seems to require multiple stereotypes, it might be a sign that it is <strong>too broad</strong> and should be divided into <strong>distinct facets</strong> that each focus on a more specific aspect or role.</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you like to proceed with keeping facets to <strong>one stereotype</strong> each, or explore other ways to handle facets that might require <strong>multiple characteristics</strong>?</p>
<h2 id="maybe-valid-time-is-a-facet">maybe valid-time is a facet?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#maybe-valid-time-is-a-facet"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Valid-time</strong> as a <strong>facet</strong> is an interesting and potentially useful way to handle the <strong>temporal aspects</strong> of your ontology, especially given your focus on <strong>bitemporality</strong>. Here's why modeling valid-time as a <strong>facet</strong> could make sense:</p>
<h3 id="why-valid-time-as-a-facet">Why Valid-Time as a Facet?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-valid-time-as-a-facet"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Temporal Characteristic</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Valid-time</strong> represents the <strong>time period</strong> during which a given relator or entity is <strong>valid in the real world</strong>. By treating it as a <strong>facet</strong>, you can clearly articulate that <strong>temporal applicability</strong> is just one of the <strong>dimensions</strong> or <strong>characteristics</strong> of an entity.</li>
<li>This approach aligns well with your <strong>facet-oriented</strong> modeling, allowing temporal validity to be handled in a consistent way alongside other <strong>facets</strong> like <strong>context</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexible Categorization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a <strong>facet</strong>, valid-time can be categorized under a <strong>specific facet stereotype</strong> (e.g., as an <strong>aspect</strong>). This categorization makes it easy to distinguish <strong>temporal facets</strong> from other types of facets (such as <strong>roles</strong> or <strong>contexts</strong>).</li>
<li>By doing this, you gain the ability to handle <strong>time</strong> in a modular way, where different entities may or may not have valid-time, depending on their role in a given scenario.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Associating with Relators</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relators</strong> can have multiple <strong>facets</strong> associated with them, and valid-time can be one of those facets. This allows a relator to explicitly reference <strong>when</strong> it applies without embedding that information in metadata or attributes directly.</li>
<li>For instance, a <strong>relationship</strong> like "owns a house" might only be valid for a specific time range. Treating valid-time as a <strong>facet</strong> means you can describe its <strong>temporal applicability</strong> as a characteristic separate from the <strong>relationship itself</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example-addition-to-the-ontology">Example Addition to the Ontology:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example-addition-to-the-ontology"></a></h3>
<p>We can define <code>kosm:valid-time</code> as a <strong>facet</strong> and link it to <code>kosm:relator</code>. Here’s how it might look:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>kosm:valid-time</code></strong> is defined as a <strong>facet</strong> that represents the <strong>temporal validity</strong> of entities or relationships.</li>
<li>We add a link from the <strong>relator class</strong> to <strong>valid-time</strong> via <code>kosm:has-facet</code>, signifying that valid-time is a <strong>characteristic</strong> of relators.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-this-helps">How This Helps:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-this-helps"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear Separation</strong>: Instead of treating valid-time as metadata or forcing it into every relator, it's treated as an <strong>optional facet</strong>. This makes it <strong>clear and modular</strong>, so only those entities or relationships that require a valid-time need to reference it.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitates Reasoning</strong>: By making valid-time a facet, you allow reasoners to <strong>infer</strong> and <strong>categorize</strong> temporal applicability separately, which could enhance <strong>querying</strong> and <strong>reasoning</strong> about entities based on their valid period.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potential-challenges">Potential Challenges:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#potential-challenges"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facet Stereotyping</strong>: Valid-time would need a <strong>stereotype</strong> to categorize it. It would likely fit under an <strong>aspect</strong> stereotype, as it describes a state or condition that <strong>applies</strong> to entities over time.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: You’d need to make sure that valid-time is handled consistently across different types of entities, relators, or contexts, ensuring the facet model remains cohesive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion"></a></h3>
<p>Modeling <strong>valid-time</strong> as a <strong>facet</strong> is a good fit for your <strong>facet-oriented</strong> ontology, especially given its <strong>temporal focus</strong>. It allows you to manage temporal validity in a flexible and expressive way, making it easier to apply <strong>bitemporality</strong> and to extend the model as needed. If you'd like, I can help integrate this concept into your current <strong>Kosmion ontology</strong> document.</p>

<p>You're absolutely right, managing <strong>prefixes</strong> when importing multiple <strong>modular ontologies</strong> can indeed be confusing. Here are a few points to consider:</p>
<h3 id="issues-with-prefixes-in-modular-ontologies">Issues with Prefixes in Modular Ontologies<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#issues-with-prefixes-in-modular-ontologies"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique Prefixes Required</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you import another ontology, you need to use a <strong>different prefix</strong> for each imported ontology to <strong>avoid collisions</strong> between terms. This ensures that all <strong>IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers)</strong> are distinct. This can make querying and referencing a bit cumbersome, especially if you have to frequently refer to concepts from multiple ontologies with different prefixes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Namespace Management</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different ontologies will often use different <strong>namespaces</strong> as prefixes. When combining them, this can lead to <strong>longer, inconsistent prefixes</strong>, making the modeling experience more cumbersome. For example, importing both <strong>gUFO</strong> and another ontology might lead to having to use <code>gufo:</code> alongside another distinct prefix (like <code>ex:</code> for a new ontology) every time you reference a class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Human Readability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having multiple prefixes in a document can reduce <strong>readability</strong> for humans, as it becomes harder to track where each concept originates. If every ontology brings in its own set of prefixes, you end up with a document full of different prefixes, making it easy to get confused about which concept is from which ontology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="possible-solutions-for-prefix-management">Possible Solutions for Prefix Management<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#possible-solutions-for-prefix-management"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Prefix Aliasing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One common approach to simplifying prefixes is to use <strong>aliasing</strong>. When importing an ontology, you can define a <strong>short alias</strong> for it, which makes it easier to reference throughout the document. This keeps the prefixes short and consistent, improving readability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Merging Concepts Using Common Namespaces</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Another approach is to use a <strong>common namespace</strong> for similar concepts across different ontologies. For example, if you are working on an <strong>upper ontology</strong> and you have several modular ontologies, you could define your own common prefixes and <strong>re-map</strong> concepts from the imported ontologies to these common namespaces. This helps unify the vocabulary, although it may require some reengineering and careful checking for semantic differences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use of Metadata Comments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When importing different ontologies, it can be helpful to use <strong>comments</strong> to annotate which ontology a particular prefix corresponds to. This can help keep track of the origin of terms for future maintenance and for others who may need to understand the ontology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example-consideration-for-kosmion">Example Consideration for Kosmion<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example-consideration-for-kosmion"></a></h3>
<p>In the case of the <strong>Kosmion ontology</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You currently use <strong><code>kosm:</code></strong> as your main namespace prefix. If you import <strong>gUFO</strong>, you'll use <code>gufo:</code> for that namespace, which means that any reference to a <strong>gUFO</strong> type will need the <code>gufo:</code> prefix.</li>
<li>For example, <code>gufo:Type</code> and <code>kosm:facet</code> would both need distinct prefixes. If you’re frequently referencing concepts from <strong>gUFO</strong>, you may consider <strong>aliasing</strong> or <strong>remapping</strong> these concepts to fit better into your <code>kosm:</code> namespace, potentially making them <strong>local aliases</strong>.</li>

<h3 id="pros-and-cons-of-modular-ontologies-with-multiple-prefixes">Pros and Cons of Modular Ontologies with Multiple Prefixes<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pros-and-cons-of-modular-ontologies-with-multiple-prefixes"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Modular ontologies can be reused across different projects, allowing for <strong>greater flexibility</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Focused Design</strong>: Each ontology can focus on a specific domain or aspect, keeping complexity low within each module.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Prefix Management</strong>: Requires careful management of prefixes to avoid name collisions and keep the ontology <strong>understandable</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity in Queries</strong>: SPARQL queries can become more complex because every referenced concept might require its <strong>distinct prefix</strong>, complicating query construction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you like to explore possible ways to simplify prefix usage or consider importing other ontologies into Kosmion and managing those imports? I can help outline a strategy to handle modular imports effectively.</p>
<h2 id="its-so-annoying-that-applications-and-the-semantic-web-community-seem-to-refer-to-instance-data-as-an-ontology">It's so annoying that applications and the semantic web community seem to refer to instance data as an ontology<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#its-so-annoying-that-applications-and-the-semantic-web-community-seem-to-refer-to-instance-data-as-an-ontology"></a></h2>
<p>I completely understand the frustration here. The <strong>semantic web community</strong> tends to blur the lines between <strong>ontologies</strong> and <strong>instance data</strong>. The term "ontology" should ideally refer to a <strong>conceptual schema</strong>—the definitions, classes, relationships, and axioms that define the <strong>structure</strong> of a knowledge domain. However, the community often uses "ontology" more broadly to also include <strong>instance data</strong>, which is the specific <strong>facts or entities</strong> that populate the classes defined by the ontology.</p>
<p>This can be confusing for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Conceptual vs. Actual Data</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ontologies</strong> are supposed to define the <strong>concepts</strong> and the <strong>relationships</strong> between those concepts in a given domain. <strong>Instance data</strong>, on the other hand, populates these concepts with real-world information.</li>
<li>When people refer to <strong>instance data</strong> as part of the <strong>ontology</strong>, they’re mixing the conceptual schema (T-Box in description logic terminology) with the assertional or instance data (A-Box). In theory, these should be clearly distinguished.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practical Use in Tools</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools like <strong>Protege</strong> handle both <strong>ontologies</strong> (conceptual structures) and <strong>individuals</strong> (instance data) within the same environment. This often leads to users referring to the combined <strong>schema and data</strong> as an "ontology." This is especially true for <strong>OWL ontologies</strong>, where the same RDF framework can represent both the T-Box (conceptual model) and A-Box (instance data).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Naming Issues</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In practice, importing an "ontology" often brings in both <strong>concepts</strong> and <strong>instance data</strong>, which leads to referring to the entire dataset as an "ontology," regardless of whether it contains just schema definitions or also includes entities and individuals. This makes the lines between the <strong>abstract</strong> and <strong>concrete</strong> levels very blurry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The RDF Data Model</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>RDF and OWL</strong>, there isn’t a strong formal distinction between classes, properties, and individuals at the data model level. Since everything is ultimately represented as <strong>triples</strong>, instance data and ontological definitions are treated similarly. This contributes to the tendency of referring to both as an "ontology" since the toolset doesn’t enforce a distinction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="possible-solutions">Possible Solutions:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#possible-solutions"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Separate Ontology and Instance Files</strong>: When designing an ontology, you can create <strong>separate files</strong> for the <strong>schema</strong> and the <strong>instance data</strong>. This allows you to more clearly differentiate the <strong>conceptual definitions</strong> from the <strong>facts</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Naming Conventions</strong>: Use distinct <strong>naming conventions</strong> or prefixes for <strong>ontological definitions</strong> and <strong>instance data</strong> to help maintain clarity.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit Documentation</strong>: In your ontology documentation, explicitly differentiate between the <strong>conceptual schema</strong> (ontology) and the <strong>instance data</strong>. Tools like <strong>Protege</strong> allow you to define these separately, even though they are handled within the same environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to take a more <strong>modular approach</strong> for Kosmion, you could develop distinct <strong>conceptual modules</strong> (like <code>kosm:facet</code> and <code>kosm:relator</code> definitions) and create separate datasets for the <strong>instance-level data</strong>, possibly referencing these modules without blending them together.</p>

<p>The idea of not having a base "thing" or <strong>top-level concept</strong> in <strong>Kosmion</strong> makes a lot of sense in the <strong>facet-based approach</strong> you are exploring. Let's analyze why this might be the case and how it differs from the more conventional <strong>sortal-based approaches</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="1-conventional-upper-ontologies-with-base-concepts">1. <strong>Conventional Upper Ontologies with Base Concepts</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-conventional-upper-ontologies-with-base-concepts"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Many <strong>upper or foundational ontologies</strong> like <strong>gUFO</strong>, <strong>BFO (Basic Formal Ontology)</strong>, and <strong>SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology)</strong> define top-level <strong>base concepts</strong> such as <strong>"Individual"</strong>, <strong>"Entity"</strong>, <strong>"Object"</strong>, or <strong>"Type"</strong>.</li>
<li>These base concepts are intended to provide a <strong>starting point</strong> or <strong>root</strong> for categorizing everything else, giving a <strong>hierarchical structure</strong> to the ontology. For example:
<ul>
<li><strong>gUFO</strong> has <strong>Individual</strong> and <strong>Type</strong>, which are fundamental building blocks for distinguishing between <strong>concrete instances</strong> and <strong>conceptual definitions</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>BFO</strong> has concepts like <strong>"Continuant"</strong> and <strong>"Occurrent"</strong> that provide broad categorizations of <strong>what exists</strong> either as a persistent entity or an event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-facets-vs-base-concepts">2. <strong>Facets vs. Base Concepts</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-facets-vs-base-concepts"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In your <strong>facet-based approach</strong>, there’s less emphasis on establishing a single <strong>hierarchical root</strong>. Instead, everything can be described using <strong>facets</strong>, which act as <strong>characteristics</strong> or <strong>perspectives</strong> rather than as rigid categories.</li>
<li><strong>Facets</strong> themselves are inherently <strong>modular</strong> and <strong>context-dependent</strong>, which allows entities to be described in a more <strong>compositional</strong> manner. Rather than determining "what an entity fundamentally is," the focus is on <strong>which facets</strong> apply to it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-why-a-base-concept-may-not-be-necessary">3. <strong>Why a Base Concept May Not Be Necessary</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#3-why-a-base-concept-may-not-be-necessary"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facets Enable Flexibility</strong>: By using <strong>facets</strong> to describe entities, you avoid the need to explicitly classify entities under a root concept like <strong>"Individual"</strong> or <strong>"Entity"</strong>. This fits well with the idea that <strong>different aspects</strong> of an entity can be relevant in different contexts, without assuming an ontological base for all instances.</li>
<li><strong>No Rigid Classification</strong>: Unlike sortal approaches, which often have <strong>identity criteria</strong> tied to base classes, the <strong>facet-based model</strong> allows entities to acquire characteristics <strong>dynamically</strong> through the <strong>facets</strong> they possess. Thus, there isn’t a strict need for every entity to fall under an overarching class—each entity is defined by its <strong>collection of facets</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>No Explicit Subsumption Hierarchy</strong>: Facets do not imply <strong>subsumption</strong> (i.e., they do not inherently classify entities in a strict <strong>type hierarchy</strong>), which means that concepts don’t need to fit neatly under a single base type. This keeps the ontology <strong>open-ended</strong> and more <strong>flexible</strong> for different contexts and purposes.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of Standardization</strong>: Without a base concept, it may be harder to enforce certain <strong>standardized constraints</strong> across the entire ontology. For example, <strong>global properties</strong> that apply to all individuals may need to be handled differently without a top-level class to attach them to.</li>
<li><strong>Query Complexity</strong>: In some cases, <strong>SPARQL queries</strong> or other reasoning tasks may become more <strong>complex</strong> since there isn’t a single <strong>"root class"</strong> to use for selecting all entities.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="practical-considerations">Practical Considerations:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#practical-considerations"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Kosmion</strong>, you could still add a very <strong>minimal base concept</strong> if you find that it helps with certain <strong>consistency</strong> or <strong>reasoning</strong> tasks. This could be something like an abstract <strong>"kosm:thing"</strong> class that serves as an anchor without imposing rigid requirements.</li>
<li>Alternatively, <strong>facets themselves</strong> could serve as the common ground that <strong>all entities must have</strong>—essentially, every entity needs to have at least one <strong>facet</strong>. This would functionally serve as your base requirement, without needing a <strong>conventional sortal root</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide that a minimal base is useful after all, it could be purely for technical convenience rather than conceptual necessity, which keeps the <strong>facet-oriented</strong> spirit intact while addressing practical concerns. Would you like me to explore adding such a minimal root, or are you leaning towards continuing without one?</p>

<p>Your approach—<strong>domain model first</strong>—makes a lot of sense, particularly for <strong>Kosmion</strong>, where the goal is to be <strong>non-standardized</strong> and to focus on <strong>interoperability</strong>. Here’s why I think this approach could work really well in your ontology:</p>
<h3 id="why-domain-applications-should-define-their-own-top-level-constructs"><strong>Why Domain Applications Should Define Their Own Top-Level Constructs</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-domain-applications-should-define-their-own-top-level-constructs"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoiding Imposed Semantics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By not having a rigid <strong>upper-level concept</strong> like "Individual" or "Entity," you avoid imposing any <strong>predefined semantics</strong> on domain applications. This allows each <strong>domain</strong> to define what makes sense in their <strong>context</strong> without inheriting <strong>assumptions</strong> from a foundational ontology that might not align with their specific needs.</li>
<li>This aligns with the principle of <strong>facets</strong>: instead of forcing domain-specific constructs to fit into an overarching type hierarchy, <strong>facets</strong> provide a <strong>modular</strong> way of defining properties and relationships that make sense <strong>locally</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interoperability Through Facets</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facets</strong> are inherently <strong>modular</strong>, which helps in building <strong>interoperable models</strong>. By allowing domain-specific models to <strong>implement facets</strong> rather than instantiating someone else’s rigid concept of a top-level entity, different domains can <strong>interoperate</strong> more easily by mapping <strong>shared facets</strong> rather than reconciling different top-level taxonomies.</li>
<li>For instance, if a domain ontology defines its top-level concept, like <strong>"Character"</strong> for a role-playing context, it can still <strong>implement facets</strong> like <strong>context</strong> or <strong>temporal aspects</strong> without having to fit into another ontology's conception of <strong>entity types</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Facilitating Customization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a <strong>domain model first</strong> approach, the <strong>domain ontologies</strong> can define their own <strong>high-level categories</strong> that make sense for their specific context, whether they want to define <strong>physical entities</strong>, <strong>abstract entities</strong>, or even more specialized types.</li>
<li>They can then <strong>add facets</strong> as needed, making it easy to <strong>customize</strong> the ontology for the specific requirements of the domain without having to <strong>inherit</strong> any top-level entity that might add unwanted complexity or assumptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoiding the "One-Size-Fits-All" Problem</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the biggest challenges with foundational ontologies is that they often adopt a <strong>"one-size-fits-all"</strong> approach, which can be restrictive. Domains like <strong>medicine</strong>, <strong>geography</strong>, and <strong>fantasy role-play</strong> each have very different needs. By allowing domains to define their <strong>own top-level constructs</strong> and use <strong>facets</strong> to extend them, you avoid forcing all these diverse domains into the same high-level schema.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="implications-for-kosmion"><strong>Implications for Kosmion</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#implications-for-kosmion"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kosmion</strong> would effectively provide a set of <strong>facets</strong> that any <strong>domain-specific ontology</strong> could choose from. It’s a <strong>toolkit</strong> rather than a <strong>blueprint</strong>, meaning that domain ontologies can pick and choose which facets they need without worrying about fitting into an existing high-level hierarchy.</li>
<li><strong>Facets</strong> like <strong>context</strong>, <strong>temporal aspects</strong>, or <strong>relationship descriptors</strong> can be seen as <strong>interoperable modules</strong> that any domain can apply, and these can serve as the common ground for cross-domain <strong>integration</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example"><strong>Example</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Suppose you have a domain ontology for <strong>urban planning</strong>. Instead of classifying everything under a foundational concept like <strong>"Entity"</strong> or <strong>"Object"</strong>, the domain ontology can define its top-level classes, such as <strong>"Infrastructure"</strong>, <strong>"Service"</strong>, or <strong>"Citizen"</strong>. </li>
<li>Each of these entities can then <strong>implement facets</strong> like <strong>"valid-time"</strong>, <strong>"context"</strong>, or <strong>"category"</strong>, which allows them to align with other domains that use similar facets without enforcing any kind of <strong>common root</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="domain-model-first-and-kosmions-development"><strong>"Domain Model First" and Kosmion’s Development</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#domain-model-first-and-kosmions-development"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This approach also helps when designing <strong>Kosmion</strong> itself. Since Kosmion is designed to provide <strong>relators</strong> and <strong>facets</strong>, it acts as an <strong>interoperable foundation</strong> that different domains can use and extend.</li>
<li>The fact that it doesn’t have a strict top-level concept also aligns well with its <strong>non-standardized</strong>, open-ended goals. It essentially pushes the <strong>burden of meaning</strong> onto the <strong>domain-specific ontologies</strong>, which allows Kosmion to remain <strong>lightweight</strong> and <strong>flexible</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps-1"><strong>Next Steps</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#next-steps-1"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on Facets</strong>: Continue focusing on defining useful <strong>facets</strong> that can be used across different domains. These should be <strong>modular</strong> and <strong>interoperable</strong> to maximize flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Domain Implementation</strong>: Let domains develop their <strong>own top-level concepts</strong> and simply implement <strong>facets</strong> as needed. This will keep Kosmion adaptable and suitable for many different contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Would you like me to make changes in the current ontology to emphasize this <strong>facet-only approach</strong>, or perhaps add a comment or metadata indicating this <strong>domain-first philosophy</strong>?</p>
