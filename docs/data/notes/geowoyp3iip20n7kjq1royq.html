<li>Victor Turner’s antitheses of structure and communitas are useful to my attempt to think about it: structure in society, in his terms, is cognitive, communitas existential; structure provides a model, communitas a pot ential; structure classifies , communitas reclassifies ; structure is expressed in legal and political institutions, communitas in art and religion.</li>
