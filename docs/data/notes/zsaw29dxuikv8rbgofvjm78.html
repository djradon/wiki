<p>Metalsmith-Semantic-Flow could be a custom plugin or an adaptation of Metalsmith tailored to handle RDF data for the Semantic Flow project. It would automate the generation of HTML pages and dataset distributions for each NamedIndividual in the namespace, all while ensuring that each dataset follows your specific conventions. Here’s a concept outline:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Parsing and Structuring</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parse RDF files (TTL, JSON-LD) within the project and map each NamedIndividual to an IRI.</li>
<li>Use the <code>_default</code> and <code>_catalog</code> structures for versioning, generating <code>_default/v1</code> datasets as the main data source and <code>_catalog/v1</code> for catalog metadata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Metadata Injection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a base template for NamedIndividuals, dynamically injecting metadata like <code>relator-genesis</code>, <code>relator-tombstone</code>, and contextual properties.</li>
<li>Auto-generate index pages (<code>index.ttl</code>, <code>index.html</code>) with <code>owl:imports</code> for linked datasets and catalogs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Namespace Handling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Host the actual namespace at a lower directory level to allow for multiple namespaces, with individual NamedIndividual pages linked at <code>/ns/namespace-name/</code>.</li>
<li>Automatically track updates in the <code>contributing-repos</code> directory, ensuring only new or modified data triggers re-rendering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Template Customization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for customizable templates per NamedIndividual type, allowing you to apply different layouts based on categories of individuals (e.g., specific templates for <code>Person</code> or <code>Location</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Versioning Workflow</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement your <code>_default</code> dataset workflow, with commit hooks or git triggers to copy new data to versioned datasets.</li>
<li>Mirror changes across versioned IRIs, using <code>_history</code> or similar paths as needed for separation between regular and historical IRIs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Catalog and Dataset Series Integration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate <code>dcat:Catalog</code> and dataset series, with a subclass like <code>ko:CatalogSeries</code> to maintain dataset continuity.</li>
<li>Generate catalog IRIs like <code>catalog/dave-richardson-catalog.ttl</code> and <code>catalog/history/v1/</code>, adding version metadata using PAV if DCAT alone doesn't suffice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>instead of "contributing-repos", let's just use "src"... it's possible people will want to generate only from a single file, or a collection of files that aren't in repos, etc.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt"></a></h3>
<p>Got it. Using "src" will make it flexible for single files or collections that aren’t repos. This should make it easier to scan for updates or new data without needing a repository structure.</p>

<p>We dropped using history or _history as part of the IRI. The version identifier indicates history, and now I'm thinking to use "current" everywhere to refer to the current dataset, and people can modify a corresponding distribution, and the modifications will get copied to a new version on commit. It'll be tricky if two different distributions are modified, but I can at least imagine software that merges two modified distributions before allowing a commit.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-1">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-1"></a></h3>
<p>Got it. Using "current" as the identifier for active datasets will streamline things, especially with a merge feature for concurrent distribution modifications. This setup should make it easier to track and update without extra history paths.</p>

<h3 id="chatgpt-2">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-2"></a></h3>
<p>Using hyphens in property names in RDF or ontologies has one main drawback: <strong>hyphens are not allowed in IRI local names</strong>, so you’ll encounter syntax errors if you try it directly. This is why hyphens aren’t typically used in RDF property or class names; instead, underscores or camelCase are common conventions. Here’s a breakdown:</p>
<h3 id="why-hyphens-are-problematic">Why Hyphens Are Problematic<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-hyphens-are-problematic"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Syntax Restriction</strong>: RDF and Turtle syntax don’t support hyphens in local names, so a property like <code>ex:has-property</code> would need to be encoded as <code>ex:has-property</code> or <code>%2D</code> for the hyphen, which can complicate readability and usability.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Hyphens create potential parsing issues in SPARQL queries, as the hyphen could be misinterpreted as a minus operator. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in queries and software that process RDF data.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#alternatives"></a></h3>
<p>Most RDF naming conventions avoid hyphens by using:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>camelCase</strong> (e.g., <code>hasProperty</code>)</li>
<li><strong>snake_case</strong> (e.g., <code>has_property</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both approaches are fully compatible with RDF syntax, maintain readability, and prevent parsing issues.</p>
<p>If you like the readability of hyphens, you might consider using them in labels (<code>rdfs:label</code> or <code>skos:prefLabel</code>) for human-readable descriptions, while keeping the technical names camelCase or snake_case.</p>

<p>For Semantic Flow data, or in general, should <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">@base (Private)</a> refer to the root of the namespace or the local path to the thing being talked about?</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-3">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-3"></a></h3>
<p>In Semantic Flow (and RDF data in general), the purpose of <code>@base</code> depends on whether you want to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consistently resolve relative IRIs</strong> across your namespace.</li>
<li><strong>Make RDF data transposable</strong> (i.e., easy to move to different hosting environments).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="options-for-base-and-their-implications">Options for <code>@base</code> and Their Implications<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#options-for-base-and-their-implications"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Using <code>@base</code> as the Root of the Namespace</strong> (e.g., <code>@base &#x3C;https://example.org/ns/></code>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: This is ideal for consistency and simplifies linking across different entities within your namespace. Relative IRIs will resolve based on this root, making it easy to reference other resources without explicitly writing the full path every time.</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: If you host Semantic Flow data on multiple sites or move your namespace, this setup could require adjustments in each file, unless IRIs are designed to be dereferenceable in the new context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using <code>@base</code> as the Local Path to the Thing Being Talked About</strong> (e.g., <code>@base &#x3C;https://example.org/ns/Thing123/></code>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: This approach is useful for datasets or files that represent single resources and are likely to be relocated independently. It makes RDF data more transposable because IRIs resolve relative to each resource's specific base.</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: Linking across different resources requires either absolute IRIs or manually adjusting relative paths, which could reduce portability if entities have internal references.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="practical-recommendation-for-semantic-flow">Practical Recommendation for Semantic Flow<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#practical-recommendation-for-semantic-flow"></a></h3>
<p>For Semantic Flow, where reusability and potential relocation are concerns, it generally makes sense to use the <strong>namespace root as <code>@base</code></strong>. This enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy referencing across resources within the namespace.</li>
<li>Consistency when multiple files or datasets are linked together.</li>
</ul>
<p>You could also combine these approaches by setting the root <code>@base</code> in most files but using specific, localized <code>@base</code> values in cases where an individual resource might be distributed or relocated independently.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-current-dataset-a-dcatseriesmember">is the "current dataset" a dcat:seriesMember?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#is-the-current-dataset-a-dcatseriesmember"></a></h2>
<p>In DCAT terms, the "current dataset" would actually be considered the latest version in a <strong>dcat:DatasetSeries</strong> rather than a <code>dcat:seriesMember</code>. Here's how this could be structured:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code></strong>: This represents the logical grouping of all versions of a dataset. In your case, the series would represent all versions of the dataset associated with a given NamedIndividual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>dcat:Dataset</code></strong> (each version): Each individual version (e.g., <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code>, etc.) would be a <code>dcat:Dataset</code> and a <strong>member of the series</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Current" Dataset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "current" dataset would be marked as the most recent version in this series.</li>
<li>You could use <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> (from the PAV ontology) on the <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code> to explicitly denote this.</li>
<li><code>dcat:hasVersion</code> could also point to the specific version if you prefer a DCAT-only approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "current" dataset is the most recent <code>dcat:Dataset</code> in a <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>, and you can identify it either as a <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> or with a <code>dcat:hasVersion</code> relation from the series itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="but-isnt-the-latest-version-also-a-dcatseriesmember">but isn't the latest version also a dcat:seriesMember<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#but-isnt-the-latest-version-also-a-dcatseriesmember"></a></h2>
<p>Yes, you're correct—the latest version (or "current dataset") is indeed a <code>dcat:seriesMember</code> within the <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>. In DCAT:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>dcat:seriesMember</code></strong> is used to denote that each version of the dataset is part of the <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>.</li>
<li>The "current dataset" is simply the most recent or latest <code>dcat:seriesMember</code> in the series.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to explicitly denote the latest version as the "current" dataset, you could:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code></strong> on the <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code> to point to the latest <code>dcat:Dataset</code> version.</li>
<li>Alternatively, <strong>apply a version property like <code>pav:hasVersion</code></strong> to the series to define each specific version, with documentation or a custom property noting the most recent member as "current."</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, the "current" dataset can be both:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A <code>dcat:seriesMember</code></strong>, as part of the <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>.</li>
<li>Explicitly referenced as the most recent or current version via additional properties if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="subject-of-hascurrentversion">subject of hasCurrentVersion<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#subject-of-hascurrentversion"></a></h2>
<h3 id="dave-3">dave<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dave-3"></a></h3>
<p>the subject of pav:hasCurrentVersion has to be a Dataset and not a DatasetSeries, right?</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-4">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-4"></a></h3>
<p>Yes, that's correct: the subject of <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> should indeed be a <strong><code>dcat:Dataset</code></strong>, not a <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>. In the PAV ontology, <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> is meant to point from one dataset version to the latest or most current version of that <strong>specific dataset</strong>.</p>
<p>For a <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>, there isn't a direct equivalent in PAV to mark the latest or current dataset in the series. However, here are some alternatives for a <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Use <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> on Each Dataset Individually</strong>: Within each dataset in the series, you can use <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> to indicate the current version of that dataset, while the <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code> simply groups all versions together without directly marking the "current" one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extend with Custom Properties</strong>: If you need the <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code> to specifically point to the "current" dataset version, a custom property like <code>:hasCurrentMember</code> or <code>:hasLatestDataset</code> could serve as a workaround to link the series to the latest dataset directly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code></strong> works well for individual datasets, not <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>.</li>
<li>For <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>, a custom property or metadata practice may be necessary to mark the "current" dataset in the series.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="so-if-the-latest-version-is-a-seriesmember-is-current-a-series-member">So if the latest version is a seriesMember, Is "current" a series member?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#so-if-the-latest-version-is-a-seriesmember-is-current-a-series-member"></a></h2>
<p>Yes, in the context you’ve described, the "current" dataset is indeed a <code>dcat:seriesMember</code> of the <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>. Since "current" refers to the latest or most recent dataset version within the series, it naturally qualifies as a series member, just like any other version.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>"current" dataset</strong> is both a <code>dcat:seriesMember</code> and the most recent version within the <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>.</li>
<li>The distinction of "current" is more about its status as the latest version, but in terms of structure, it's treated the same as other series members.</li>
</ul>
<p>If desired, additional metadata or a custom property could be used to highlight this version as "current," though it remains a series member like previous versions.</p>
<h2 id="current-as-working-dataset">current as working dataset<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#current-as-working-dataset"></a></h2>
<h3 id="dave-4">dave<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dave-4"></a></h3>
<p>I'm thinking to have "/current" duplicate the content in the latest version, e.g. "/v2", although it's also the working copy, so if the repo hasn't been committed, it could diverge. I think that argues for the dataset with IRI "/current" is a series member.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-5">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-5"></a></h3>
<p>That makes sense. Treating <code>"/current"</code> as a <code>dcat:seriesMember</code> fits well with the idea of it being both the latest <em>stable</em> version and a potentially <em>working</em> copy, depending on commit status. This approach keeps <code>"/current"</code> aligned structurally within the <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>, while also allowing flexibility for updates or in-progress changes. This way, <code>"/current"</code> remains clearly part of the series, and versioning only applies upon commit.</p>

<p>The choice between <code>dcat:hasCurrentVersion</code> and <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> comes down to subtle differences in focus and intended use within <strong>DCAT</strong> and <strong>PAV</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="dcathascurrentversion"><code>dcat:hasCurrentVersion</code><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dcathascurrentversion"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain</strong>: Designed specifically for datasets in the DCAT vocabulary.</li>
<li><strong>Scope</strong>: Primarily applies to a <code>dcat:Dataset</code> to indicate its latest version.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Best used if your main objective is to align with the DCAT standard for data catalogs and datasets, especially when interoperability within DCAT-based ecosystems is essential.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pavhascurrentversion"><code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pavhascurrentversion"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain</strong>: PAV (Provenance, Authoring, and Versioning ontology) applies broadly to versioned entities, not just datasets, which makes it flexible for items outside traditional datasets.</li>
<li><strong>Scope</strong>: Can apply to any versionable entity, including individual files or other non-dataset resources.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Ideal if you need a broader versioning and provenance framework, especially when detailed attribution (author, version history) is needed alongside version tracking.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-practice">In Practice<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#in-practice"></a></h3>
<p>For <strong>Semantic Flow</strong>, if you are versioning entities strictly as datasets, <code>dcat:hasCurrentVersion</code> might provide a more standardized approach. However, if you need more granular provenance and attribution details, <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> could be more versatile. Both can technically coexist if you need the best of both worlds.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-there-no-concept-of-catalogseries-as-a-subclass-of-datasetseries">why is there no concept of CatalogSeries as a subclass of DatasetSeries?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-is-there-no-concept-of-catalogseries-as-a-subclass-of-datasetseries"></a></h2>
<p>The absence of a <strong><code>CatalogSeries</code></strong> in DCAT as a subclass of <code>DatasetSeries</code> likely stems from how catalogs and datasets are conceptually distinguished:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary Purpose Difference</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catalogs</strong> (<code>dcat:Catalog</code>) are primarily organizational structures used to list and describe datasets, often functioning as indexes rather than as content holders themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Datasets</strong> (<code>dcat:Dataset</code>), by contrast, are data containers with evolving content, and <code>DatasetSeries</code> was introduced specifically to handle versioned datasets with data that changes over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Cases in DCAT</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>DCAT assumes catalogs are relatively stable structures that reference datasets, and that changes in datasets are more frequent. In DCAT's design, if a catalog is modified, it’s often to reflect updates in its listed datasets rather than in its own versioned content.</li>
<li>However, in setups like yours, where catalog evolution might need tracking (e.g., across multiple catalog versions in Semantic Flow), a <code>CatalogSeries</code> class could indeed be useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workarounds in Practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you need catalog versioning, creating a <code>CatalogSeries</code> as a subclass of <code>DatasetSeries</code> in your ontology could make sense. This allows you to keep track of multiple catalog versions as they change, much like you would for datasets. It would also mean you could apply versioning properties (e.g., <code>dcat:hasVersion</code>) and other metadata tracking to catalogs themselves.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you could use <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code> directly for catalogs if you don’t mind the name, treating each catalog version as a dataset series member.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The absence of <code>CatalogSeries</code> is likely due to assumptions in DCAT about catalogs being relatively stable, but nothing prevents adding it if your use case involves more dynamic catalog tracking.</p>

<p>Using a property like <code>has_current_trig_distribution</code> and setting the distribution URL directly as the IRI for the distribution has a few advantages and trade-offs compared to the traditional approach with <code>dct:format</code> and <code>dcat:accessURL</code>.

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly using the URL as the IRI simplifies the distribution metadata, especially if the format is unlikely to change frequently.</li>
<li>A <code>has_current_trig_distribution</code> property can directly specify the URL without needing a separate identifier and properties to link to the access URL and format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced Redundancy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminates the need for a separate <code>dcat:Distribution</code> instance with <code>dct:format</code> and <code>dcat:accessURL</code>, making data more compact and easier to parse if the format is implied by the URL or file extension (e.g., <code>.trig</code>).</li>
<li>For data catalogs with many distributions, this approach minimizes metadata overhead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Streamlined Access</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly linking the latest distribution URL in the <code>has_current_trig_distribution</code> property improves clarity and accessibility for end-users, as the current version is immediately accessible without navigating additional properties.</li>
<li>Reduces potential confusion, as <code>has_current_trig_distribution</code> would consistently point to the latest accessible distribution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Compatibility for Linked Data Applications</strong>:</p>

<li>If the format of the distribution could change (e.g., from TriG to Turtle), the traditional approach with <code>dct:format</code> provides clear metadata for content negotiation or processing.</li>
<li>The <code>dct:format</code> and <code>dcat:accessURL</code> properties allow distribution formats to be easily changed or expanded (e.g., adding new formats without replacing the entire URL), which is less flexible when the URL itself is used as the identifier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compatibility with DCAT Standards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The traditional approach aligns with DCAT’s standard for distributions, enabling richer interoperability in multi-format or multi-language datasets where each distribution might have different access conditions or properties.</li>
<li>Using a custom property like <code>has_current_trig_distribution</code> might limit compatibility with DCAT-compliant tools and catalogs, which typically expect <code>dcat:Distribution</code> with <code>dct:format</code> and <code>dcat:accessURL</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Less Granular Metadata for Access and Licensing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>dcat:Distribution</code> allows attaching additional metadata, like licensing terms (<code>dct:license</code>), access rights, or availability details, which can be useful if distributions are governed by distinct terms.</li>
<li>If specific metadata is required on each distribution (e.g., to specify licensing), this approach may not provide enough flexibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommendation">Recommendation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#recommendation"></a></h3>
<p>If simplicity and ease of access are priorities, using <code>has_current_trig_distribution</code> with the URL directly as the IRI can work well, especially if the format and access conditions are unlikely to change. However, if interoperability, format flexibility, or licensing metadata are important, the traditional <code>dcat:Distribution</code> model might be more robust, enabling richer metadata while preserving standards compliance.</p>

<p>Trade-off #1 isn't an issue because the format is specified in the property and a distribution always has a format. For Trade-off #3 each distribution can still have its own metadata.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-8">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-8"></a></h3>
<p>Given these clarifications, the approach with <code>has_current_trig_distribution</code> and using the URL as the distribution IRI becomes even more compelling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimal Redundancy</strong>: Since the format is directly tied to the property, you avoid duplicative metadata while still clearly identifying each distribution’s format.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Access and Simplicity</strong>: With the URL as the IRI, access is streamlined, and there’s no need to navigate through separate distribution objects, which makes it more user-friendly.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Metadata</strong>: If each distribution can still carry its own metadata (e.g., licensing), this approach provides the flexibility of traditional <code>dcat:Distribution</code> structures without the extra layers, which could be especially helpful for Semantic Flow’s design.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, this setup preserves all the benefits of simplicity and accessibility while sidestepping the typical limitations, making it a strong alternative to the standard distribution structure.</p>

<ol>
<li>

<ul>
<li>Define a custom property like <code>:hasCurrentDataset</code> or <code>:currentMember</code> on the <code>dcat:DatasetSeries</code>, pointing to the IRI of the latest or current dataset.</li>
<li>This approach is clear and lets you directly reference the current dataset, but it does require defining and maintaining a custom property in your ontology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> on the Dataset Itself</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>While not directly on the <code>DatasetSeries</code>, adding <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> to the most recent <code>dcat:Dataset</code> within the series effectively designates it as the current dataset.</li>
<li>This method is ideal if you’re using the PAV ontology for versioning and provenance, as <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> is widely recognized for designating the current version.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use an Annotation on the Current Dataset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of directly on the series, you could annotate the latest <code>dcat:Dataset</code> member itself with a property like <code>dct:description "Current version"</code> or another appropriate annotation.</li>
<li>Although it’s less direct, this could work as a practical workaround for tools or applications to recognize the current dataset by reading the annotation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alias the Current Dataset to a Consistent IRI</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>As you’re considering with <code>"/current"</code>, you could set up an alias IRI (e.g., <code>&#x3C;https://example.org/dataset/current></code>) that always resolves to the latest dataset. This is an external solution but a convenient, widely compatible way to represent "current" without internal properties.</li>
<li>This alias can be updated to point to the newest dataset IRI as each version is released, preserving the series structure while maintaining a single entry point for the current dataset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommendation-1">Recommendation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#recommendation-1"></a></h3>
<p>For Semantic Flow, where simplicity and future-proofing are priorities, an <strong>alias for <code>"/current"</code></strong> combined with <strong><code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code></strong> on the latest dataset would be both effective and standards-aligned. This approach leverages existing properties without custom extensions, providing both internal and external ways to recognize the current dataset.</p>

<p>I've been resisting having to declare NamedIndividuals as Datasets (because they aren't, really.) So to use my dataset-based versioning, I've introduced the concept of a _default dataset. I guess only individuals get a _default dataset. </p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-9">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-9"></a></h3>
<p>That makes sense. The <code>_default</code> dataset allows you to use dataset-based versioning without reclassifying NamedIndividuals as Datasets, preserving the distinction between entities and data collections. This approach keeps the structure intuitive, as only individuals would have <code>_default</code> datasets for tracking versions, while other entities remain unaffected by dataset-based semantics.</p>
<h2 id="i-think-dataset-can-live-anywhere-in-a-namespace-no-need-to-separate-them-out">I think dataset can live anywhere in a namespace, no need to separate them out.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#i-think-dataset-can-live-anywhere-in-a-namespace-no-need-to-separate-them-out"></a></h2>
<p>That’s a flexible approach and simplifies the structure by allowing datasets to coexist with other resources within the same namespace. This setup should make linking and referencing between datasets and NamedIndividuals more straightforward without a rigid separation.</p>

<p>should the default catalog series be at _catalog or _cat_series. If _cat_series, then the current catalog would be at &#x3C;_cat_series/current> which kinda reads like "current catalog series", but it's similar to "ns" being the set of namespaces... does the path part represent what it is, or what the sub-parts are. I guess from rest, sub-parts.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-10">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-10"></a></h3>
<p>[a bunch of back and forth and then...]</p>
<p>If there’s no "current series," then keeping the shorter paths for individual resources (e.g., <code>/_catalog/current</code> for the current catalog and <code>/_default/current</code> for the current dataset) makes perfect sense. This approach preserves clarity because:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><code>/_catalog/current</code></strong> directly implies the current catalog within the series.</li>
<li><strong><code>/_default/current</code></strong> directly refers to the latest dataset in the <code>_default</code> series.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this structure, the paths remain humane and clear, as there's no risk of confusion about a "current series" that doesn't exist. Each path speaks directly to the resource level (catalog or dataset), making it clear you’re referencing the latest version within each respective series. This approach strikes a good balance between readability and precision without extra verbosity.</p>

<h2 id="chatgpt-11">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-11"></a></h2>
<p>Yes, DCAT catalogs can indeed include other catalogs, and not just as sub-catalogs. Catalogs can reference related catalogs at any level of association, depending on how they’re connected to the catalog's subject. Here’s how this can be handled in DCAT:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>dcat:Catalog</code> and <code>dcat:Dataset</code> Flexibility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In DCAT, catalogs can include other catalogs using <code>dcat:hasPart</code>, <code>dcat:relatedResource</code>, or simply <code>dcat:dataset</code>.</li>
<li>For example, <code>dcat:hasPart</code> can indicate catalogs closely tied to the subject or domain of the parent catalog.</li>
<li><code>dcat:relatedResource</code> can be used more loosely for any catalog linked to the subject, even if it’s not a strict sub-catalog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linking Other Subject-Related Catalogs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To express a looser or thematic relationship (where the catalog isn’t necessarily a subset but shares relevance), <code>dcat:relatedResource</code> or <code>dct:relation</code> can be used to link catalogs.</li>
<li>This approach supports a flexible, many-to-many relationship where catalogs can cross-reference others, creating a network of related resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DCAT Extension Possibilities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If more specific relationships are needed, creating a custom property like <code>:relatedCatalog</code> to handle thematic or subject-based relationships could offer clearer semantics, while still allowing the broader catalog network to grow flexibly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows catalogs in DCAT to organize a range of related data resources in ways that go beyond hierarchical sub-catalogs, making cross-referenced collections possible.</p>

<p>In a file-based RDF approach like semantic flow, it seems like there might be some value in using inverse properties, especially for statements whose inverse is not in the current file. But arguably even within the same file. e.g., for a human reader, browsing the block about a catalog, seeing "&#x3C;_catalog/current> sflo:default_catalog_series_for <d> tells you right away what the catalog is about, instead of having to find the block about <d>

<h3 id="chatgpt-12">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-12"></a></h3>
<p>Using inverse properties in Semantic Flow can indeed improve readability, especially in a file-based approach. By directly indicating relationships, like <code>&#x3C;_catalog/current> sflo:default_catalog_series_for &#x3C;d></code>, you provide a complete view of the catalog’s purpose without needing to track down additional blocks. This strategy can also simplify file parsing and browsing for human readers, as context is self-contained within each resource description. </p>
<p>It’s a great approach for RDF that supports both machine and human use, enhancing navigability without sacrificing data integrity.</p>

<p>True—while inverse properties do add the need for dual updates, in a quasi-immutable system, that drawback is less impactful due to the infrequency of modifications.

<h3 id="chatgpt-15">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-15"></a></h3>
<p>Correct, <strong>release functionality</strong> isn’t part of Git itself; it’s specific to platforms like <strong>GitHub</strong> (and GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.). </p>
<p>In Git:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tags</strong> are the closest concept to releases. You can use tags to mark specific commits as "version points" (e.g., <code>v1.0</code>, <code>v1.1</code>), which can signal a "release" manually.</li>
<li>Git alone doesn’t distinguish between regular tags and release tags, so it lacks built-in support for formal "release" metadata like changelogs, release notes, or attachments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>GitHub</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Releases build on Git tags, allowing you to add release notes, attach files, and manage version metadata.</li>
<li>When you create a release, it automatically tags a commit, but it also provides a structured space for release-related info, making it easier to track stable versions in a user-friendly way.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in a Git-based workflow like Semantic Flow, you could use tags for release points if you need cross-platform compatibility. On GitHub, releases are more formalized, allowing more comprehensive version management.</p>

<p>I'd originally thought that a sflo:DataRepo would have a set of folders corresponding to different namespaces. But a sflo:DataRepo should just be able to have different datasets. I'm start to suspect that each sflo:Namespace will have to be versioned separately, perhaps in sflo:NamespaceRepos with a version bump any time any contained NamedIndividual or Dataset gets changed (Might have to go back to version-per-commit.)</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-16">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-16"></a></h3>
<p>Allowing any <code>DataRepo</code> to trigger updates in a site-contained <code>sflo:Namespace</code> introduces both flexibility and potential complexity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic Catalog Updates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic bumps in the <code>sflo:Namespace</code> catalog on every commit could ensure that each change is captured, but it would require a robust tracking system to handle simultaneous or sequential updates across multiple <code>DataRepos</code>.</li>
<li>This would streamline catalog maintenance but might need more sophisticated conflict resolution if different <code>DataRepos</code> impact the same namespace concurrently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-Repo Dependencies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If multiple <code>DataRepos</code> can update a single namespace, dependency management becomes crucial. Each <code>DataRepo</code> would need to understand the impact of its updates on the broader namespace catalog.</li>
<li>Implementing a mechanism to check dependencies or relationships between updates across <code>DataRepos</code> could prevent accidental overwrites or conflicts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This setup could scale well for modular, autonomous updates if designed carefully. Each <code>DataRepo</code> could contain localized metadata indicating what part of the <code>sflo:Namespace</code> it affects, which might help with automatic catalog bumps and consistent versioning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Exploring these implications could clarify the best approach for balancing automation and control, especially if a CI/CD process manages the bumps and dependencies across <code>DataRepos</code>.</p>

<p>I think sflo versioning might have to be independent of github versioning. Sure, a namespace catalog gets a version bump every time some contained entity does, but repo-based versioning isn't going address entity-level versions, and having two independent versioning systems seem inelegant. </p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-17">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-17"></a></h3>
<p>Separating <code>sflo</code> versioning from GitHub’s repo-level versioning makes sense if you’re tracking changes at the entity level. This approach allows precise versioning control within <code>sflo</code> without the limitations of GitHub’s broader repo-based versioning, where individual entity changes aren’t granularly captured.</p>
<p>You could structure <code>sflo</code> versioning to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Track entity-level changes</strong> directly within the namespace catalog, so each entity has its own version history independent of Git commits.</li>
<li><strong>Version the entire namespace catalog</strong> on entity changes but keep these changes within the <code>sflo</code> system, freeing you from GitHub’s versioning structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, <code>sflo</code> can focus on entity-level precision, while GitHub can manage broader changes, such as repository organization or significant configuration updates, without conflict between the two systems.</p>
<h3 id="dave-17">dave<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dave-17"></a></h3>
<p>So no need for a sflo:NamespaceRepo per site namespace? </p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-18">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-18"></a></h3>
<p>Correct, if <code>sflo</code> versioning operates independently and tracks entity-level changes directly within the namespace catalog, you wouldn’t necessarily need a <code>sflo:NamespaceRepo</code> per site namespace. Instead, each namespace can be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Contained within a single catalog</strong>: The namespace catalog can manage all versioning, providing a central version history for contained entities.</li>
<li><strong>Independently versioned within <code>sflo</code></strong>: Entity-level versions can be tracked without needing a separate repository structure, keeping the versioning self-contained and lightweight.</li>
</ol>
<p>This structure simplifies things, as each namespace catalog can manage its entities’ versions without requiring GitHub repos to mirror the namespace-level structure, reducing duplication and keeping <code>sflo</code>-specific versioning flexible.</p>
<h3 id="dave-18">dave<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dave-18"></a></h3>
<p>So versioning of entities happens when a site build is triggered. sflo:DataRepos are sync'd (pulled and if any local changes, pushed). Any in-scope changes in sflo:DataRepo repositories in the src directory trigger updates to entity catalogs and creation of new entities. Any changes in "current" files is detected, a new dataset version is generated (probably as a canonicalization of the current file), and the namespace catalog is updated and bumped as well. The problem I see is that DataRepo dataset/files aren't necessarily published, so the catalogs of entities referenced in the DataRepos don't have anything to point to. </p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-19">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-19"></a></h3>
<p>The lack of published datasets in <code>sflo:DataRepo</code> files does present a challenge for building coherent catalogs. Here are a few potential ways to address this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Temporary Placeholders in Entity Catalogs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>sflo:DataRepo</code> files aren’t published, you could include placeholders (e.g., "unpublished" or "pending publication") in the catalogs for those entities.</li>
<li>This approach keeps catalog entries complete but flags any references that currently lack accessible data, signaling where updates are needed once the datasets are published.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conditional Publication Workflow</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a step where only published datasets/files in <code>sflo:DataRepo</code> are cataloged, while unpublished entities are temporarily excluded.</li>
<li>This keeps catalogs clean by omitting references to unpublished data, then adding them once the data becomes available in a subsequent build.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incremental Build Process with Publication Check</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>During site builds, check each <code>DataRepo</code> for published status. If unpublished, either delay the catalog update or insert a pending status into the catalog to avoid broken links.</li>
<li>When the unpublished <code>DataRepo</code> files become available, catalog links can update automatically, filling in any gaps in previous builds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These strategies could allow you to manage entity versioning independently while keeping catalogs as complete as possible.</p>
<h3 id="dave-19">dave<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dave-19"></a></h3>
<p>You could just mint IRIs for every sflo:DataRepo. But you'd want to be able to configure whether the content of those DataRepos gets published, and probably we'd want an option to obscure the name if that were sensitive. And an option to just not even refer to the DataRepo in the referenced entity's catalog at all.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-20">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-20"></a></h3>
<p>Minting IRIs for every <code>sflo:DataRepo</code> with configurable publication settings sounds like a flexible solution. Here’s how this could be structured:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Configurable Publication Control</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <code>sflo:DataRepo</code> could have metadata flags (e.g., <code>sflo:publishContent</code>, <code>sflo:obscureName</code>, <code>sflo:excludeReference</code>) to indicate whether:
<ul>
<li>Its content is published.</li>
<li>The name should be anonymized.</li>
<li>It should be excluded from catalogs altogether.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic IRI Management</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For sensitive or unpublished <code>DataRepos</code>, IRIs could resolve to minimal metadata, providing a placeholder or generic label if accessed directly.</li>
<li>When <code>sflo:publishContent</code> is enabled, IRIs could point to the full data distribution, while unpublished repos return a "restricted" message or nothing if <code>sflo:excludeReference</code> is active.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Catalog Customization per Entity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entity catalogs could dynamically include or omit <code>DataRepo</code> references based on these flags, ensuring only relevant or non-sensitive data is presented to end-users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This setup keeps entity catalogs complete and flexible, with controls over what’s accessible, how it’s presented, and whether it’s referenced at all.</p>

<p>RI minting for DataRepos should definitely be opt-in. Supporting obscure names bring up another feature: aliasing. I guess you can just use owl:SameAs, but if the DataRepo changes names, it might be hard to figure out if they're the same repo.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-21">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-21"></a></h3>
<p>Making IRI minting for <code>DataRepos</code> opt-in is a solid approach, especially if some <code>DataRepos</code> require aliasing due to name changes. Here’s a possible way to handle aliasing without relying solely on <code>owl:sameAs</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Explicit <code>sflo:alias</code> Property</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a custom property, like <code>sflo:alias</code>, to capture alternative names or previous IRIs for a <code>DataRepo</code>.</li>
<li>This would provide more control than <code>owl:sameAs</code>, allowing for historical tracking of name changes or rebranding without full equivalency implications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintaining an <code>sflo:DataRepoID</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign each <code>DataRepo</code> an internal, immutable identifier (e.g., <code>sflo:dataRepoID</code>) that remains consistent across name changes.</li>
<li>If the <code>DataRepo</code> name changes, you can still track it back to the same <code>dataRepoID</code>, which can link the aliases back to the original IRI if needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Annotation Metadata for Previous IRIs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use annotation properties (e.g., <code>sflo:previousIRI</code>) to log older IRIs without making them semantically equivalent. This helps preserve the change history without creating ambiguous relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach maintains backward compatibility and makes it easier to track <code>DataRepos</code> even if names change over time, while avoiding the potential complications of <code>owl:sameAs</code>.</p>

<li>A <strong>namespace folder</strong> (like your top-level <code>"d"</code> folder) represents a distinct <code>sflo:Namespace</code> and is organized to mirror the site’s namespace hierarchy.</li>
<li>The folder hierarchy under the namespace is meant to directly correspond to how the resources are structured in the namespace itself, which is useful for maintaining clarity and consistency across the entire site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General Data Folders</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General folders</strong> are more flexible, holding various datasets or data files that may not directly represent namespaces. They could contain ad-hoc data to be scanned and used for minting IRIs or managing specific entities without adhering to a strict namespace structure.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pros-of-maintaining-the-distinction"><strong>Pros of Maintaining the Distinction</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pros-of-maintaining-the-distinction"></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity and Structure</strong>: Keeping a clear separation makes it easy to differentiate between the parts of the <code>sflo:DataRepo</code> that are meant to establish formal namespaces and those meant for general data or supporting entities.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency in Handling</strong>: Namespace folders can follow stricter rules regarding how data is published, linked, and versioned, while general folders can remain more loosely managed, reducing the risk of accidentally treating general data as namespace-defining.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-of-the-distinction"><strong>Cons of the Distinction</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cons-of-the-distinction"></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Added Complexity</strong>: Explicitly distinguishing between these types of folders adds structural complexity. Contributors to the <code>sflo:DataRepo</code> need to understand which folder serves what purpose and follow specific conventions, which may lead to errors or extra work.</li>
<li><strong>Redundancy</strong>: If general data folders end up contributing to a namespace indirectly, the line between a general folder and a namespace folder could blur. This distinction may not always provide added value, especially if many of the files in general folders are still tied to the broader namespace.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternative-unified-folder-approach"><strong>Alternative: Unified Folder Approach</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#alternative-unified-folder-approach"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Formal Distinction</strong>: Instead of having explicit "namespace" versus "general" folders, consider treating <strong>all folders as potentially part of a namespace</strong>. Under this approach:
<ul>
<li>Any folder can be <strong>scanned for IRIs</strong> and <strong>dynamically assigned</strong> to a namespace if the data implies it.</li>
<li>Namespace identification could be determined by the metadata within the folder's datasets rather than a strict folder structure.</li>
<li>This flexible approach could still allow top-level folders to be identified as namespaces when needed (e.g., by metadata in their default dataset) but would avoid forcing a binary distinction on every folder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="recommendation-2"><strong>Recommendation</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#recommendation-2"></a></h3>
<p>If clarity around namespaces and general data is critical to your Semantic Flow system and if each serves distinctly different purposes, <strong>keeping the distinction</strong> may be beneficial. It will ensure the namespace-defining elements remain consistent and predictable.</p>
<p>However, if you prefer simplicity and flexibility—where folders could evolve in their roles or contribute to namespaces more fluidly—<strong>removing the strict distinction</strong> and treating folders dynamically may be the better approach. You can always use metadata within folders to determine if they define or contribute to a namespace on an as-needed basis, allowing for a more organic structure that’s easier to maintain.</p>
<h3 id="dave-22">dave<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dave-22"></a></h3>
<p>For #1, it doesn't just mirrror the hierarchy, it is the hierarchy, or at least provides it. Also, your alternative "unified" approach seems the same as my distinct approach, where the metadata in the top-level folder indicates that it is a namespace.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-23">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-23"></a></h3>
<p>You're right, I see where the misunderstanding occurred. Let's refine these points based on your feedback:</p>
<h3 id="1-namespace-folder-as-the-hierarchy">1. <strong>Namespace Folder as the Hierarchy</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-namespace-folder-as-the-hierarchy"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>namespace folder</strong> isn’t just mirroring the hierarchy; it <strong>defines and provides</strong> the hierarchy itself. The structure of the folder (e.g., <code>d/</code>) directly represents the namespace, ensuring that the hierarchical relationships between entities are inherent to the folder structure.</li>
<li>This means that the folder organization plays a critical role in the <strong>namespace's identity</strong>, where subfolders and files map directly to elements and concepts in the namespace.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="revised-view-on-the-alternative-approach">Revised View on the Alternative Approach<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#revised-view-on-the-alternative-approach"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>unified approach</strong> I described, the idea was to potentially avoid labeling folders explicitly as “namespace” or “general” and instead let their metadata define their role dynamically. However, as you pointed out, that’s essentially similar to your current approach, where the metadata (e.g., in the default dataset) declares that a folder is a namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both your original and the "unified" approach I described, the <strong>metadata in the top-level folder</strong> is what determines whether it acts as a namespace or not. The distinction is mostly about <strong>conventions</strong> and <strong>formal labeling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your Approach</strong>: You have a <strong>clear convention</strong>—if a folder is a namespace, it’s identified as such by the presence of specific metadata, and the folder’s structure <strong>defines the namespace’s hierarchy</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>My Alternative</strong>: I suggested avoiding an explicit <strong>predefined distinction</strong> by letting metadata decide dynamically, but this ends up very similar to your method. The key difference would only be in whether you <strong>formalize</strong> this distinction ahead of time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-unified-model-with-metadata">A Unified Model with Metadata<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#a-unified-model-with-metadata"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Namespace-Defining Metadata</strong>: In your model, the top-level folders provide the structure, and the presence of metadata indicating <code>sflo:Namespace</code> makes it a namespace. </li>
<li><strong>General Folders</strong>: Any other folder without this namespace-level metadata can be treated as a <strong>general data folder</strong>. It may still contain resources, but it doesn’t establish a formal namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practical terms, it seems like <strong>formalizing the distinction</strong> is helpful for clarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes it easier for collaborators or automated tools to understand what each folder represents.</li>
<li>It ensures that changes in folders (e.g., new data additions) can be clearly associated either with a namespace or simply as new data contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>By maintaining your <strong>two types of folders</strong>, you effectively manage the distinction while allowing metadata to play the central role in <strong>identity and hierarchy provisioning</strong>. This approach remains structured while minimizing ambiguity, particularly as the dataset grows or as multiple contributors participate.</p>

<p>does it make sense for a CatalogSeries to have a distribution? I don't think so. Even though it's a dataset, it's a collection of catalogs so would the distribution just be a set of named graphs that corresponded to the catalogs?</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-24">chatgpt<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#chatgpt-24"></a></h3>
<p>You're right—it doesn't quite make sense for a <strong>CatalogSeries</strong> to have a distribution in the traditional sense, even though a <strong>CatalogSeries</strong> can technically be treated as a dataset. Here’s a more detailed analysis:</p>
<h3 id="catalogseries-and-distribution-considerations">CatalogSeries and Distribution Considerations<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#catalogseries-and-distribution-considerations"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Nature of a CatalogSeries</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>CatalogSeries</strong> is essentially a collection of multiple <strong>catalogs</strong>, each representing a version or variation over time.</li>
<li>Unlike a typical dataset, which might have straightforward data files or documents that can be distributed directly, a CatalogSeries is more abstract—it points to catalogs rather than containing independent data records that can be easily distributed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distribution of a Dataset vs. CatalogSeries</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>dataset</strong> typically has a distribution—files that represent the dataset’s content (e.g., in CSV, JSON, RDF).</li>
<li>For a <strong>CatalogSeries</strong>, having a distribution would imply that you are somehow “packaging” multiple catalogs into a unified set of downloadable or queryable data. However, catalogs are already abstractions pointing to datasets, and adding a distribution at the series level doesn’t align well with their purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What Would a Distribution of a CatalogSeries Mean?</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you tried to provide a <strong>distribution for a CatalogSeries</strong>, it would essentially mean providing access to <strong>all the versions of catalogs</strong> within the series.</li>
<li>The distribution might be thought of as a <strong>set of named graphs</strong>, each corresponding to a different catalog, but this would be cumbersome and redundant, especially since each individual catalog already has its own distribution.</li>
<li>Such a distribution would likely end up being a meta-aggregation, which isn’t practical for consumers interested in individual catalogs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternatives to Distributions for CatalogSeries</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of providing a distribution, a <strong>CatalogSeries</strong> should simply <strong>reference each catalog</strong> in the series. Users can then navigate to individual catalogs and access their distributions directly.</li>
<li>You could provide metadata (e.g., via SPARQL endpoints or navigable catalogs) that makes it easier to browse catalogs in the series, but without bundling them as a formal distribution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Named Graphs as Distributions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>While you could represent a <strong>CatalogSeries</strong> as a <strong>set of named graphs</strong>, with each graph representing one catalog, this approach has limitations:
<ul>
<li>It complicates the data model without adding much practical value.</li>
<li>Consumers usually want to access a specific catalog and its datasets, not an abstract, bundled series.</li>
<li>Named graphs could serve better as a mechanism for internal tracking or provenance, rather than as public-facing distributions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommendation-3">Recommendation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#recommendation-3"></a></h3>
<p>It’s more consistent with the purpose of a <strong>CatalogSeries</strong> to <strong>not have a distribution</strong>. Instead, the <strong>CatalogSeries</strong> should focus on providing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Links to each catalog version</strong> via properties like <code>dcat:hasVersion</code> or similar.</li>
<li><strong>Metadata that describes the series as a whole</strong> (e.g., the scope of what the series covers, changes over time).</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach keeps the model clean and avoids unnecessary complexity, while ensuring that the intended audience has a clear path to accessing the data they need—namely, through the distributions of the individual catalogs within the series.</p>
<h2 id="same-with-a-defaultdatasetseries-or-any-series">Same with a DefaultDatasetSeries, or any series?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#same-with-a-defaultdatasetseries-or-any-series"></a></h2>
<p>Yes, the same logic applies to a <strong>DefaultDatasetSeries</strong> or indeed <strong>any type of series</strong>—it doesn't generally make sense for these series themselves to have a distribution. Here’s a detailed breakdown:</p>
<h3 id="nature-of-datasetseries-and-defaultdatasetseries">Nature of DatasetSeries and DefaultDatasetSeries<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#nature-of-datasetseries-and-defaultdatasetseries"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>DatasetSeries</strong> (including <strong>DefaultDatasetSeries</strong>) represents <strong>a collection of related datasets</strong>, each of which may be a different version or variation. The <strong>series</strong> acts as a container to logically group these datasets over time.</li>
<li>Like a <strong>CatalogSeries</strong>, a <strong>DatasetSeries</strong> is not meant to be a direct provider of content—it’s a conceptual structure meant to <strong>link individual datasets</strong> that evolve or are versioned.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-datasetseries-should-not-have-a-distribution">Why DatasetSeries Should Not Have a Distribution<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-datasetseries-should-not-have-a-distribution"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstract Structure</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>DatasetSeries</strong> is an abstraction, just like a CatalogSeries. Its role is to provide context and relationships between datasets, not to aggregate or package them directly for distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Distributions</strong> are typically used for datasets to describe downloadable files or formats that represent the content of that dataset (e.g., CSV, JSON-LD, RDF files).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Complexity of Aggregating Data</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you were to add a <strong>distribution</strong> for a DatasetSeries, you would effectively be aggregating multiple versions or instances of datasets.</li>
<li>This would be confusing to consumers because they generally interact with datasets individually, accessing the version they need. Packaging multiple datasets together in a series-level distribution creates potential for redundancy and adds unnecessary complexity, especially when dealing with large datasets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Redundancy and Overhead</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each dataset in the series should have its own <strong>distribution</strong> (or set of distributions) that represents the actual content. Including a distribution at the series level would often duplicate this information.</li>
<li>It also adds an additional maintenance overhead—each time a dataset is added or updated in the series, the series-level distribution would need to be regenerated, which introduces logistical challenges without adding significant practical benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="preferred-handling-of-datasetseries">Preferred Handling of DatasetSeries<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#preferred-handling-of-datasetseries"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Link to Individual Dataset Versions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>DatasetSeries</strong> should primarily serve to <strong>reference</strong> individual datasets using properties like <code>dcat:hasVersion</code> or <code>dcat:seriesMember</code>.</li>
<li>Consumers can then navigate to the specific dataset and access its distributions directly, whether it's a Turtle, JSON-LD, or any other format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Metadata to Describe the Series</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rather than having a distribution, the series can provide <strong>descriptive metadata</strong> that gives context on the set of datasets it contains. For example, it can describe the purpose of the series, provide version histories, and detail changes across the datasets in the series.</li>
<li>This provides value without confusing the consumer about what data to download or reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Named Graphs and Internals</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there's a need to track relationships or provenance across multiple datasets, named graphs could be used internally to represent this, but these should remain <strong>internal mechanisms</strong> rather than public-facing distributions.</li>
<li>Named graphs are good for representing internal relationships or grouping datasets in a queryable form, but not necessarily as a method of presenting a packaged distribution to end-users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="in-summary">In Summary<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#in-summary"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>DatasetSeries</strong>, <strong>DefaultDatasetSeries</strong>, <strong>CatalogSeries</strong>, or <strong>any type of series</strong> should <strong>not have a distribution</strong>.</li>
<li>Each individual dataset or catalog within a series can and should have its own distributions that represent its content, while the <strong>series itself</strong> remains a <strong>structural and organizational entity</strong>.</li>
<li>The series provides navigational and contextual metadata but leaves the actual data handling to the individual members, avoiding unnecessary complexity and redundancy.</li>

</ul>
<p>If you want to support edits before a dataset is finalized, distinguishing between "current" and "draft" (or "soon") versions can definitely help manage expectations and workflows effectively. Here's how you could handle this distinction:</p>
<h3 id="differentiation-of-versions">Differentiation of Versions<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#differentiation-of-versions"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>"Current" Version</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>"current"</strong> version is the one that's actively used and considered stable, representing the dataset as it is right now.</li>
<li>In the <strong>PAV ontology</strong>, <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> indicates the version that is in active use, which may not be the most recently edited version if those edits haven’t been finalized yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Draft" or "Soon" Version</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>"draft"</strong> or <strong>"soon"</strong> version represents a work-in-progress—something that is still under development but hasn’t been released officially.</li>
<li>This version can be continuously updated as changes are made, but it remains marked as <strong>not finalized</strong>, ensuring users know it’s subject to further edits.</li>
<li>This helps to decouple the working copy from the "official" or "current" version, providing more control over when a version is considered ready to be minted and published.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3 id="implementation-with-pav-support">Implementation with PAV Support<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#implementation-with-pav-support"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>PAV Properties</strong>: PAV provides several properties that can help manage different stages of dataset versions:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code></strong>: Marks the version that is currently active but not necessarily the latest (e.g., the stable version).</li>
<li><strong><code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code></strong>: You could use this property or create a similar one to indicate that there is an <strong>editable draft</strong> in progress.</li>
<li><strong><code>pav:hasPreviousVersion</code></strong> and <strong><code>pav:hasVersion</code></strong>: To keep track of historical versions and navigate between different stages in the dataset lifecycle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Initial Versioning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dataset is created and assigned a version, say <strong>v1.0</strong>, and marked as <strong><code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code></strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Draft Stage</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes begin on a new version. This in-progress version is marked with something like <strong><code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code></strong> and is given a working identifier, such as <strong><code>draft</code></strong> or <strong><code>v1.1-draft</code></strong>.</li>
<li>Users or contributors can continue to edit this draft until it's ready for release.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Release Process</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the draft is finalized, it can be assigned a new version number (e.g., <strong>v1.1</strong>), and it becomes the new <strong><code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code></strong>.</li>
<li>The former version (v1.0) is then assigned <strong><code>pav:hasPreviousVersion</code></strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="practical-considerations">Practical Considerations<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#practical-considerations"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Clearly label draft versions to indicate that they are not stable or final. This can prevent accidental use of incomplete or incorrect data.</li>
<li><strong>Separate IRIs for Drafts</strong>: Consider using a separate IRI or suffix (e.g., <code>/current/draft</code>) for draft versions to keep them distinct from officially released versions.</li>
<li><strong>Editable State</strong>: Treat drafts as mutable and editable until release, while treating minted versions as immutable to maintain data integrity and consistency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary"></a></h3>
<p>Using <strong>"current"</strong> vs. <strong>"draft"</strong> (or <strong>"soon"</strong>) effectively supports workflows where datasets undergo significant edits before finalization. By leveraging properties like <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> and potentially introducing a draft indicator (<code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code> or similar), you maintain clear distinctions between the stable, released state of the data and the evolving, in-progress state. This approach also aligns with PAV’s intended use of versioning properties, allowing for a flexible, robust version control system that accommodates ongoing edits.</p>

<li>
<p>dave: As we've kinda discussed ,pav:hasCurrentVersion seems problematic because the domain would be another dataset, and I don't want to duplicate (and have to update it) for every version of the dataset. Is pav:hasDraftVersion a confabulation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chatgpt:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, you are correct—<strong><code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code></strong> is indeed something I proposed as a potential extension based on the idea of needing a property to manage draft versions. It’s not an existing property in the <strong>PAV (Provenance, Authoring, and Versioning)</strong> ontology. I made it up as a conceptual solution, but there isn't a formal <strong><code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code></strong> property in the PAV vocabulary.</p>
<h3 id="about-pavhascurrentversion-limitations">About <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> Limitations<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#about-pavhascurrentversion-limitations"></a></h3>
<p>The challenge with <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>It assumes a <strong>dataset-level</strong> scope, meaning that each dataset instance would point to its current version, rather than having a series-level property that designates which version is the current one.</li>
<li>You'd have to attach <strong><code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code></strong> to each dataset version to indicate what’s current, which leads to duplication and maintenance issues as versions change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="possible-solutions-without-duplication">Possible Solutions Without Duplication<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#possible-solutions-without-duplication"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Series-Level Metadata with a Custom Property</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of duplicating <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code>, consider creating a <strong>series-level property</strong> for your needs. For example:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>sflo:currentVersion</code></strong>: This could be a custom property defined on your <code>DatasetSeries</code> or <code>DefaultDatasetSeries</code>, pointing to the current dataset.</li>
<li><strong><code>sflo:workingVersion</code></strong>: You could also introduce a custom property like <code>sflo:workingVersion</code> to indicate a draft or under-development version.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a Singleton for the "Current" Dataset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a consistent <strong>IRI alias</strong> that always points to the current version of the dataset (e.g., <code>&#x3C;namespace/current></code>). This would represent the "current" dataset, while <code>&#x3C;namespace/v1></code>, <code>&#x3C;namespace/v2></code>, etc., would denote the specific versions.</li>
<li>This makes it easy to update what “current” means without having to add properties to multiple dataset versions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Version Control Through Annotations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could add metadata annotations within the series or namespace-level catalog that <strong>flag</strong> which dataset is the draft or current version. </li>
<li>This keeps the versioning metadata centralized, which avoids having to repeat updates across multiple dataset versions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Draft Property for Working Copies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of <code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code>, you could define a <strong><code>sflo:hasDraftVersion</code></strong> property that allows you to indicate a draft version.</li>
<li>This property could be applied at the <strong>DatasetSeries</strong> level, clearly indicating which version is currently in a draft state without cluttering up individual dataset metadata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="summary-1">Summary<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary-1"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code></strong> was a <strong>conceptual suggestion</strong>, not an official part of PAV. Creating a custom equivalent for Semantic Flow (<code>sflo:hasDraftVersion</code>) would give you control without duplicating information.</li>
<li>To avoid version duplication, it’s best to manage <strong>"current"</strong> and <strong>"draft"</strong> states at the <strong>series level</strong> or via an <strong>IRI alias</strong> that always points to the current working version.</li>
<li>Custom properties like <strong><code>sflo:currentVersion</code></strong> and <strong><code>sflo:workingVersion</code></strong> could provide the flexibility needed for editing, releasing, and clearly managing draft states without the overhead of version-level repetition.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach should give you a more elegant and scalable solution for managing dataset versioning while avoiding the pitfalls of <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> in a DatasetSeries context.</p>

<h3 id="practical-considerations-1">Practical Considerations<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#practical-considerations-1"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Clearly label draft versions to indicate that they are not stable or final. This can prevent accidental use of incomplete or incorrect data.</li>
<li><strong>Separate IRIs for Drafts</strong>: Consider using a separate IRI or suffix (e.g., <code>/current/draft</code>) for draft versions to keep them distinct from officially released versions.</li>
<li><strong>Editable State</strong>: Treat drafts as mutable and editable until release, while treating minted versions as immutable to maintain data integrity and consistency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary-2">Summary<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary-2"></a></h3>
<p>Using <strong>"current"</strong> vs. <strong>"draft"</strong> (or <strong>"soon"</strong>) effectively supports workflows where datasets undergo significant edits before finalization. By leveraging properties like <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> and potentially introducing a draft indicator (<code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code> or similar), you maintain clear distinctions between the stable, released state of the data and the evolving, in-progress state. This approach also aligns with PAV’s intended use of versioning properties, allowing for a flexible, robust version control system that accommodates ongoing edits.</p>

<ul>
<li>dave: As we've kinda discussed ,pav:hasCurrentVersion seems problematic because the domain would be another dataset, and I don't want to duplicate (and have to update it) for every version of the dataset. Is pav:hasDraftVersion a confabulation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, you are correct—<strong><code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code></strong> is indeed something I proposed as a potential extension based on the idea of needing a property to manage draft versions. It’s not an existing property in the <strong>PAV (Provenance, Authoring, and Versioning)</strong> ontology. I made it up as a conceptual solution, but there isn't a formal <strong><code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code></strong> property in the PAV vocabulary.</p>
<h3 id="about-pavhascurrentversion-limitations-1">About <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> Limitations<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#about-pavhascurrentversion-limitations-1"></a></h3>
<p>The challenge with <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>It assumes a <strong>dataset-level</strong> scope, meaning that each dataset instance would point to its current version, rather than having a series-level property that designates which version is the current one.</li>
<li>You'd have to attach <strong><code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code></strong> to each dataset version to indicate what’s current, which leads to duplication and maintenance issues as versions change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="possible-solutions-without-duplication-1">Possible Solutions Without Duplication<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#possible-solutions-without-duplication-1"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Series-Level Metadata with a Custom Property</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of duplicating <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code>, consider creating a <strong>series-level property</strong> for your needs. For example:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>sflo:currentVersion</code></strong>: This could be a custom property defined on your <code>DatasetSeries</code> or <code>DefaultDatasetSeries</code>, pointing to the current dataset.</li>
<li><strong><code>sflo:workingVersion</code></strong>: You could also introduce a custom property like <code>sflo:workingVersion</code> to indicate a draft or under-development version.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a Singleton for the "Current" Dataset</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a consistent <strong>IRI alias</strong> that always points to the current version of the dataset (e.g., <code>&#x3C;namespace/current></code>). This would represent the "current" dataset, while <code>&#x3C;namespace/v1></code>, <code>&#x3C;namespace/v2></code>, etc., would denote the specific versions.</li>
<li>This makes it easy to update what “current” means without having to add properties to multiple dataset versions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Version Control Through Annotations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could add metadata annotations within the series or namespace-level catalog that <strong>flag</strong> which dataset is the draft or current version. </li>
<li>This keeps the versioning metadata centralized, which avoids having to repeat updates across multiple dataset versions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Draft Property for Working Copies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of <code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code>, you could define a <strong><code>sflo:hasDraftVersion</code></strong> property that allows you to indicate a draft version.</li>
<li>This property could be applied at the <strong>DatasetSeries</strong> level, clearly indicating which version is currently in a draft state without cluttering up individual dataset metadata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="summary-3">Summary<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary-3"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>pav:hasDraftVersion</code></strong> was a <strong>conceptual suggestion</strong>, not an official part of PAV. Creating a custom equivalent for Semantic Flow (<code>sflo:hasDraftVersion</code>) would give you control without duplicating information.</li>
<li>To avoid version duplication, it’s best to manage <strong>"current"</strong> and <strong>"draft"</strong> states at the <strong>series level</strong> or via an <strong>IRI alias</strong> that always points to the current working version.</li>
<li>Custom properties like <strong><code>sflo:currentVersion</code></strong> and <strong><code>sflo:workingVersion</code></strong> could provide the flexibility needed for editing, releasing, and clearly managing draft states without the overhead of version-level repetition.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach should give you a more elegant and scalable solution for managing dataset versioning while avoiding the pitfalls of <code>pav:hasCurrentVersion</code> in a DatasetSeries context.</p>
<h2 id="separate-drafts">separate drafts<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#separate-drafts"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>dave: If we do separate drafts, things get more complicated but current could just owl:imports (or similar custom property) the current version. Drafts would definitely have a separate IRI, but it'd be more like /_default/draft-2024-10-30-djradon. But I think it's too complicated, at least for now. Using current to draft provides a single point of focus, and multiple editors would have to merge their changes to current. Nothing's preventing people from starting their own drafts in the series I suppose, but those things don't get released as versions until current changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chatgpt:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That makes sense as a more streamlined approach. Using <code>current</code> as the focus for collaborative editing simplifies the workflow, with a single point of truth that everyone works on. This reduces the complexity of managing distinct draft versions and keeps the release process clear—only <code>current</code> gets formally promoted to a new version.</p>
<p>Allowing individuals to work on their own drafts within the series as-needed is a good compromise: it gives flexibility without overcomplicating the main versioning flow. Essentially, the <code>current</code> serves as the "official" working draft, while other drafts remain informal until they contribute directly to <code>current</code>. This keeps things manageable, especially at this stage, while still offering room for experimentation.</p>

<p>Exactly! The idea for <strong>Metalsmith-SFLO</strong> can evolve into a powerful tool that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mint IRIs or Update Catalogs/Datasets</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Specified Entities</strong>: Allowing the tool to operate on <strong>individual entities</strong> gives fine-grained control, letting users focus on updating or minting IRIs for only the items they’re currently modifying or adding.</li>
<li><strong>Entire Namespace</strong>: Supporting operations on <strong>all entities within a namespace</strong> would enable bulk actions, such as when an entire namespace needs new versioning or catalog updates.</li>
<li><strong>All Namespaces</strong>: Allowing <strong>global operations across all namespaces</strong> is the ultimate bulk operation, useful for consistent metadata application or major systemic updates.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Full-Scope Namespace Management</strong>:

<h3 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#implementation-details"></a></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Entity-Level Action</strong>: Specify the entity directly (e.g., via its IRI) to mint a new IRI or make updates.</li>
<li><strong>Namespace-Level Action</strong>: Select a namespace folder to mint IRIs or update all datasets contained within.</li>
<li><strong>Global Action</strong>: Choose to operate on every namespace for changes that need to be system-wide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IRI Minting and Consistency</strong>: 
<ul>
<li>Ensure <strong>new IRIs</strong> are minted according to your conventions, with unique identifiers for each new entity.</li>
<li>For <strong>updating catalogs</strong>, it could trigger the required metadata adjustments or add new datasets as part of the catalog.</li>

<h3 id="potential-challenges">Potential Challenges<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#potential-challenges"></a></h3>

Implementing <strong>batch processing</strong> and <strong>version control</strong> will be essential to ensure smooth updates without overwhelming the system.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency Control</strong>: If <strong>multiple editors</strong> are involved, there needs to be a solid way of managing <strong>merge conflicts</strong>—especially when working on the <code>current</code> draft version for multiple datasets simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary-4">Summary<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary-4"></a></h3>
<p>Eventually, <strong>Metalsmith-SFLO</strong> will provide flexibility at every level:</p>

<li><strong>Namespace</strong>: Bulk operations when updating standards or releasing a new version for related entities.</li>
<li><strong>Global</strong>: Full control across the entire Semantic Flow setup to ensure consistency.</li>

<ul>
<li>dave: it could be hard to ensure unique identifiers. If there's a path to it in a sfNamespaceRepo, it's an IRI. But contributing sfDataRepos could include whatever IRIs they want, so if they choose an existing IRI, seems like confusion could result. </li>
</ul>
<p>You're absolutely right. This potential overlap could definitely lead to issues if unique identifiers aren’t properly managed, especially since <strong>IRIs</strong> are supposed to be globally unique to prevent confusion.</p>
<h3 id="strategies-to-ensure-unique-identifiers">Strategies to Ensure Unique Identifiers<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#strategies-to-ensure-unique-identifiers"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Centralized IRI Management</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a <strong>registry</strong> for IRIs in the <code>sfNamespaceRepo</code> to act as the source of truth. Every time a new IRI is minted by any <code>sfDataRepo</code>, it should be checked against this registry to ensure uniqueness.</li>
<li>This centralized system would help in preventing two <code>sfDataRepos</code> from accidentally using the same IRI for different entities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prefix Control</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage contributing <code>sfDataRepos</code> to use unique <strong>prefixes</strong> for all IRIs they mint. For example, a <code>sfDataRepo</code> could be given a reserved namespace prefix, such as <code>https://example.org/sfDataRepo1/</code>, so all minted IRIs from that repo would be under this prefix.</li>
<li>This would help in avoiding conflicts, since the prefix itself would denote the source, thus differentiating entities even if they had the same local name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IRI Verification During Builds</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>During a <strong>site build</strong>, have Metalsmith-SFLO <strong>scan</strong> all contributing <code>sfDataRepos</code> and the main <code>sfNamespaceRepo</code> to verify that all IRIs are unique.</li>
<li>If a collision is detected (i.e., an IRI in a <code>sfDataRepo</code> matches one already present in the namespace repo or another <code>sfDataRepo</code>), the build process could flag it and prevent deployment until the conflict is resolved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Contributors</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish <strong>guidelines</strong> for <code>sfDataRepo</code> contributors on how to mint IRIs. Providing a clear policy, such as using only specific namespace prefixes or consulting the registry before minting new IRIs, can reduce the likelihood of duplication.</li>
<li>A convention like appending a <strong>UUID</strong> or a <strong>timestamp</strong> to ensure each new IRI is distinct could also help in avoiding accidental overlap.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Namespace Scoping</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a <strong>namespace-based scoping mechanism</strong> to allow the IRIs minted by each contributing <code>sfDataRepo</code> to be considered unique within their namespace context.</li>
<li>This could involve creating a unique path or container for each <code>sfDataRepo</code> so that even if two repos have IRIs with the same local name, the path differentiation ensures that they are treated as separate entities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="dealing-with-conflicts">Dealing with Conflicts<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dealing-with-conflicts"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If two IRIs <strong>do conflict</strong> during a build, it would be useful to have a system where:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>warning</strong> is generated, listing which <code>sfDataRepo</code> IRIs are conflicting.</li>
<li>The contributors can either <strong>update</strong> their IRIs or <strong>alias</strong> them if they are intentionally trying to reference the same entity (though this would need to be flagged explicitly to avoid ambiguity).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing these measures, you can help ensure that IRIs remain unique across all contributing sources, which will mitigate confusion and maintain the integrity of your data. This will be especially important as the number of contributors and datasets grows.</p>

<ul>
<li>dave:</li>
</ul>
<p>I think #2 Prefix Control would be the right way to go... and it seems very similar to #5, EXCEPT: I had recently introduced a level of redirection, e.g. "my-first-sfDataRepo", with a top-level folder "d" representing a namespace. The though was "one or more namespaces per repo" and also "multiple repos per namespace". I think we have to support the use case where IRIs are minted, data is catalogued and served from some original repo that you don't have write access to, and you want to expand on that data, so you add your own repo. Maybe we "just leave it to the application"... the user would have to take responsibility for collisions. But assuming they were using pre-existing data on a new site... Usually the <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">@base (Private)</a> would be changed to reflect the new site, but you could also leave the existing base everywhere and then just use a new base for the new data, and the old data wouldn't be minting new IRIs, it would just be present in the catalogs as is.</p>
<ul>
<li>chatgpt:</li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds like a practical approach to balancing <strong>flexibility</strong> and <strong>control</strong>, especially given the complexities of managing multiple <strong>contributing repositories</strong> that might reference or extend existing namespaces. Let’s break this down based on the scenario and your latest thoughts:</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge-multiple-repos-per-namespace-one-or-more-namespaces-per-repo">The Challenge: Multiple Repos per Namespace, One or More Namespaces per Repo<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-challenge-multiple-repos-per-namespace-one-or-more-namespaces-per-repo"></a></h3>
<p>The setup you're describing involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple namespaces in a single repo</strong> (<code>sfDataRepo</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Multiple repos contributing to the same namespace</strong>.</li>
<li>Supporting cases where <strong>users cannot modify</strong> the original repo (e.g., they want to extend data from a read-only or an external source).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potential-solutions-for-handling-iris-and-namespace-collisions">Potential Solutions for Handling IRIs and Namespace Collisions<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#potential-solutions-for-handling-iris-and-namespace-collisions"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Prefix Control with Dynamic Base Changes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By using <strong>prefix control</strong>, each <code>sfDataRepo</code> maintains a consistent prefix for minting new IRIs. This prefix would be unique to the repo, such as <code>https://example.org/my-first-sfDataRepo/</code>, which effectively separates all minted IRIs and prevents collision.</li>
<li>This matches the original use case, where different prefixes per repo act as namespaces, and every new entity gets a unique IRI relative to that prefix.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leveraging <code>@base</code> Flexibly</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><code>@base</code></strong> IRI approach can indeed be useful here. When extending data from a repo you <strong>don’t control</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The existing data could keep its original <strong><code>@base</code></strong>—ensuring all IRIs point back to the original source and avoiding minting new IRIs needlessly.</li>
<li>Any <strong>new data</strong> you add in your <code>sfDataRepo</code> can use a <strong>new <code>@base</code></strong>, representing your current site or namespace. This ensures that new IRIs won’t interfere with the original IRIs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This approach means the <strong>catalog will serve as an aggregator</strong>, bringing together original data from other repos and your new contributions, with each piece retaining a clear distinction in its origin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Redirection and Expansion of Catalogs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing a level of <strong>redirection</strong> could help manage when the original repo and extended data must coexist:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>top-level folder</strong> (<code>d</code> for example) acts as a namespace but also serves as a reference point for where the data originated.</li>
<li>The <strong>new repo</strong> can use a folder like <code>/d-new/</code> to represent its contribution while referencing <code>/d/</code> for the original namespace data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The idea is to allow <strong>redirected catalogs</strong> to explicitly point to both original and extended data, giving users the full picture without risk of IRIs being conflated or overwritten.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsibility on the User</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultimately, for cases where users are contributing without direct coordination (e.g., someone extending data from a read-only repo):
<ul>
<li>It could be reasonable to <strong>leave the responsibility</strong> for avoiding IRI collisions to the users themselves. Proper guidelines and tools can support this:
<ul>
<li>For example, automated <strong>collision checks</strong> during site build or catalog generation could warn users if they are inadvertently minting conflicting IRIs.</li>
<li>This would provide enough flexibility for the more complex use cases (e.g., expanding on external data) without enforcing overly rigid control mechanisms that limit what users can do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="practical-example">Practical Example<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#practical-example"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Suppose <strong>Repo A</strong> hosts an original namespace with the <code>@base</code> set to <code>https://original-site.org/ns/</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Repo B</strong>, which adds new data, wants to extend the existing namespace.
<ul>
<li><strong>Existing Data</strong>: Retains <code>https://original-site.org/ns/</code> as the <code>@base</code>, meaning the data is copied but not minting new IRIs.</li>
<li><strong>New Data</strong>: Repo B adds its own namespace or data contributions using <code>https://new-site.org/ns/</code> as the <code>@base</code>. The new entities have IRIs unique to this new base, ensuring clarity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary-5">Summary<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary-5"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prefix Control</strong> works well for general collision avoidance, and <strong><code>@base</code> flexibility</strong> allows users to easily extend namespaces without clashing with original IRIs.</li>
<li><strong>Redirection through folders</strong> can help logically separate original vs. new contributions while allowing both to be accessed from a unified catalog.</li>
<li>Ultimately, <strong>user responsibility</strong>, with some automation support (e.g., collision checks or warnings), is a good compromise to handle more complex extension cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach keeps <strong>original data intact</strong> while giving flexibility to extend and adapt new information, without unduly complicating IRI management.</p>
<h2 id="sameas-for-new-iris-dave">sameAs for new IRIs (dave)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#sameas-for-new-iris-dave"></a></h2>
<p>I think both with prefix control and maybe with redirection/expansion, you need a way to owl:sameAs the original IRI. But maybe that could be handled by the site generator. If you're generating a new site from existing sfDataRepos, the static site generator could prompt or guess for the new base and insert the sameAs in the next default dataset version.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Base Prompting and Auto-Detection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When generating a new site from existing <code>sfDataRepos</code>, the static site generator could <strong>prompt the user</strong> for the new <code>@base</code> to use.</li>
<li>If the user doesn’t specify one, the generator could also <strong>make a best guess</strong>—e.g., by applying a consistent naming convention (like appending <code>-new</code> to the original base).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insertion of <code>owl:sameAs</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>After determining the new base, the generator could then <strong>insert <code>owl:sameAs</code></strong> relationships between the original and newly generated IRIs.</li>
<li>This ensures that both the original data and any new contributions are <strong>linked explicitly</strong>, preserving the connection to the original IRI and avoiding confusion about duplicate entities.</li>
<li>The <strong>next default dataset version</strong> could include these <code>owl:sameAs</code> triples, helping to make it clear that the entities are semantically identical, despite being represented in a new base.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Versioning the New Site</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The generator could version the <strong>updated catalog or dataset</strong> automatically, ensuring that the changes (including <code>owl:sameAs</code> additions) are properly versioned and tracked.</li>
<li>This would mean that every time a new site is generated, an updated version is created for the dataset, explicitly showing the link between old and new IRIs.</li>

<li><strong>Automated Process</strong>: Automating this through the site generator reduces manual errors and makes it easier for contributors to expand on existing datasets without worrying about IRI collisions.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility for Extension</strong>: Contributors can work freely on extending the data, knowing that any <strong>existing relationships</strong> are properly acknowledged through automated equivalency assertions.</li>
</ul>
<p>By having the <strong>static site generator</strong> handle <code>owl:sameAs</code> statements in this way, you avoid the need for users to manage these details manually, which significantly reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies and ensures a more intuitive workflow.</p>
