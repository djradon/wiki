  - SECS has been designed to push the user mentality away from the classic definition of an entity being just an ID. SECS instead promotes the conceptual aspect of an entity. Personally, I like to have the rule that an entity must reflect a design entity that the user can experience. In doing so, the name of the entity usually comes from the Game Design Document. This also promotes ubiquitous language between designers and coders.
