<li>Object mapping is a broken metaphor.</li>
<li>When we pick apart a label like "system bus", and thus the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/omnibus">etymology of "omnibus"</a>, we begin to see the exercise of <em>naming things</em> in two parts. The first, and more obvious, is the coining of terms. The more important second part is the construction of metaphors.</li>
<li>Object DBs simply never took off. An object isn’t a simple or intuitive concept; an object is type-matching dynamic dispatch implemented over a collection of closures which in turn share a second collection of lexically-bound variables which themselves are — you guessed it — more objects.</li>

<ul>
<li>Roughly, there are two categories of triples: RDF triples, which attempt to encode relationship semantics, and EAV triples,</li>
<li>purity can be a dangerous waste of time</li>
<li>triples by their very nature only describe relationships. Despite their name, relational databases consign the very notion of a "relationship" to the realm of the derivative. Triples have the opposite problem. Triples treat nouns as second-class citizens.
<ul>
<li>If triples are to say anything about the form of the data they contain, we must slather them in complicated ontologies.</li>
