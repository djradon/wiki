<li>asked: Does anyone know if Memphis and Memphis Cloud have websocket (i.e., browser) support? There's <a href="https://github.com/nats-io/nats.ws">https://github.com/nats-io/nats.ws</a> and given that Memphis has NATS at its core, it seems like it might be possible?

I've been looking for a messaging solution for my product-dream for a while, and was looking at NATS as a "better Kafka", so then naturally stumbled onto Memphis.

Thank you, thats great
Memphis definetly removes much of the heavy-lifting both Kafka and NATS reveal
Can I ask about the use case? Why WS is needed?

Sure! I'm working on a role-playing platform. Not a game, but a way for people to create and play their own games/experiences. So, among other things, it's an agent-based framework where people can build and share their characters, plot lines, societies, and worlds. </p>
<p>Ideally, people will be able to run their own agents, or spawn agents written by others (i.e., directly from github) into a browser. That way, people don't need to run a node.js server locally. We wouldn't want to run arbitrary code in the game service, so just providing access to a queue for agent commands/intent  from the browser and having browser-based agents collecting "world update events" and sensory data events from other queues provides a clean separation for agent self-hosting. </p>
