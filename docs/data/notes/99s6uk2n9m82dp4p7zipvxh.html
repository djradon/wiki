<p>The core principle of tableau reasoning involves the following steps:</p>
<pre><code>Representation of Logical Expressions: The reasoner represents the logical expressions or statements (such as those in an ontology) in a structured form, often as a tree or a set of interconnected nodes.

Expansion Rules: The tableau method applies a series of expansion rules to these expressions. These rules systematically break down complex expressions into simpler components.

Branching: The process often involves creating branches in the tableau, each representing different scenarios or interpretations of the logic. For example, if an expression contains a disjunction (an "or" statement), the tableau might branch into two paths, one for each part of the disjunction.

Checking for Contradictions: The reasoner checks each branch for contradictions. A branch is closed (considered unsatisfiable) if it contains a contradiction.

Satisfiability Determination: If at least one branch of the tableau remains open (without contradictions), the original set of expressions is considered satisfiable. If all branches are closed, the expressions are unsatisfiable.

<p>In the context of ontologies and semantic web technologies, tableau-based reasoners are used to check the consistency of ontologies, to infer implicit knowledge, and to classify entities in the ontology. They are particularly well-suited for expressive logic languages like OWL DL and OWL 2, which require sophisticated reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>Examples of tableau-based reasoners include Pellet, HermiT, and Fact++. These reasoners are integral to many applications in the semantic web, artificial intelligence, and knowledge management, where they help to automate the process of reasoning about complex and interconnected data.</p>
