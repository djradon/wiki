<p>maybe you just need publishers to say "this is a published subject indicator"</p>

<li>"Subjects": "can be anything deserving to be identified, named, represented and generally talked about - otherwise said a subject of conversation"</li>
<li>"topic": " the representation, inside an application, of an unique, well-defined, and non-ambiguous subject"</li>
<li>"Published Subject Identifier" is a URI that resolves to a "human-interperable" "Published Subject Indicator": basically just provide an enumeration of "published subjects" which is an improvement because "publisher's statement of purpose, disambiguation of the subject, and stability. </li>
<li>Recommendations:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommendation 1 :</p>
<pre><code>A Published Subject Indicator should provide human-readable metadata.
</code></pre>
<p>Recommendation 2 :</p>
<p>   A Published Subject Indicator should provide machine-processable metadata.</p>
<p>Machine-processable metadata is recommended so that applications can use more information on the subject than solely URI identification.</p>
<p>Human-readable as well as machine-processable metadata can be included in the Subject Indicator itself (e.g. RDF metadata), or in a separate resource referenced from the Subject Indicator (e.g. XTM metadata).
Deliverable 2 will provide complementary recommendations on the nature of those metadata.</p>
<p>Recommendation 3 :</p>
<p>   Metadata defined in 1 and 2 should be consistent, but not necessary equivalent.</p>
<p>Consistency between human-readable and machine-processable metadata is the warrant of consistent "interpretation" by applications and humans. This can be achieved, for example, by human-readable metadata being an expression of machine-processable metadata. This issue will be addressed by Deliverable 2.</p>
<p>Recommendation 4 :</p>
<p>   Published Subject Indicator should indicate that it is intended to be a PSI.</p>
<p>This statement of purpose has to be clearly endorsed by the publisher (see below).</p>
<p>Recommendation 5 :</p>
<p>   Published Subject Indicator should identify its publisher.</p>
<p>Publisher is to be understood here in its Dublin Core definition: "An entity responsible for making the resource available."</p>
<p>Statement of purpose and Publisher identification are the warrants of trust, fundamental to efficient PSI mechanism.</p>
