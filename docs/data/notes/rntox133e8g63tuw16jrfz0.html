<p>Ontologies specifically designed to describe fictional universes are relatively rare but have garnered interest in the academic and cultural heritage communities. These ontologies aim to capture the complex relationships, entities, and events within fictional narratives, allowing for structured analysis and data interoperability. Here are some notable examples:</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#summary"></a></h3>
<p>While ontologies like OntoMedia and the ABC ontology are well-known for their application in narrative and multimedia contexts, other ontologies such as the Narrative Ontology, LODE, and even FOAF can be adapted to describe fictional universes. These ontologies provide structures for modeling events, characters, relationships, and other elements within fictional narratives, making them useful tools for projects that seek to analyze or manage fictional content.</p>

<p>You're touching on a significant issue in the Semantic Web and digital humanities, especially in the context of the FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) model, which introduces the concepts of Work, Expression, Manifestation, and Item (WEMI). This model is used to describe different levels of abstraction in bibliographic resources, but it can create ambiguity when using IRIs to identify these entities.</p>
<h3 id="the-httprange-14-issue-analogy">The httpRange-14 Issue Analogy:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-httprange-14-issue-analogy"></a></h3>
<p>The httpRange-14 issue dealt with the ambiguity of IRIs on the web, specifically whether an IRI identifies a document or a concept described by that document. Similarly, in the WEMI model, an IRI could be ambiguous if it doesn't clearly indicate whether it refers to a Work, Expression, Manifestation, or Item.</p>

<p>Including the class (or type) in the IRI could help clarify the level of abstraction the IRI is meant to identify, but this approach has both pros and cons:</p>
<h3 id="pros-of-including-the-class-in-the-iri"><strong>Pros of Including the Class in the IRI:</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#pros-of-including-the-class-in-the-iri"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Disambiguation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helps clarify what the IRI represents, reducing confusion about whether it refers to a Work, Expression, Manifestation, or Item.</li>
<li>Makes it easier for humans and machines to understand the nature of the resource directly from the IRI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourages a consistent naming convention, which can make large datasets easier to manage and navigate.</li>
<li>Facilitates better data integration and linking across different datasets and ontologies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ease of Querying</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves the clarity of SPARQL queries, as the IRI itself provides hints about what kind of entity it identifies, potentially reducing the need for additional filtering or type checking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cons-of-including-the-class-in-the-iri"><strong>Cons of Including the Class in the IRI:</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cons-of-including-the-class-in-the-iri"></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Over-Specification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedding the class in the IRI can lead to a rigid structure, which might become problematic if the classification of an entity changes over time.</li>
<li>Limits flexibility in how entities are used or interpreted in different contexts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IRI Longevity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best practices suggest that IRIs should be persistent and stable over time. If the class of an entity changes, having the class embedded in the IRI might necessitate changing the IRI, which could lead to issues with link rot or outdated references.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Namespace Management</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing namespaces with class-based IRIs could become cumbersome, especially in large and complex datasets where entities might belong to multiple classes or where class distinctions are not always clear-cut.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="alternative-approaches">Alternative Approaches:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#alternative-approaches"></a></h3>
<p>Instead of embedding the class in the IRI, you could use other methods to disambiguate the entity type:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Explicit Typing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use RDF types (<code>rdf:type</code>) to explicitly declare the type of each entity. This keeps the IRI clean and allows for flexible classification.</li>
<li>Example:
<pre class="language-turtle"><code class="language-turtle"><span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">exampleWork</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">frbr<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Work</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
<span class="token function"><span class="token prefix"><span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">exampleExpression</span></span> <span class="token keyword">a</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token prefix">frbr<span class="token punctuation">:</span></span><span class="token local-name">Expression</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contextual Metadata</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide additional metadata or contextual information alongside the IRI to clarify what the IRI refers to.</li>
<li>Use descriptive RDF properties that convey the specific nature of the resource (e.g., <code>dct:hasFormat</code>, <code>dct:isVersionOf</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hierarchical Naming</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a hierarchical or segmented naming convention within the IRI, which can suggest a broader context without strictly embedding the class.</li>
<li>Example: <code>http://example.org/resource/work/12345</code> vs. <code>http://example.org/resource/expression/12345</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use of URN/UUIDs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider using URNs or UUIDs as IRIs to avoid the issue of embedding type information. The type can be handled through metadata rather than within the IRI itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion"></a></h3>
<p>Including the class in the IRI can be a helpful way to disambiguate references to different levels of abstraction, especially in complex models like WEMI. However, it also introduces rigidity and potential challenges with IRI management. The best approach often depends on the specific needs of your project, the stability of your classifications, and how the IRIs will be used and maintained over time. Balancing clarity with flexibility is key, and sometimes a combination of clear IRIs and rich metadata provides the best of both worlds.</p>
