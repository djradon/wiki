## Description

- Members of the Open Government Data community have proposed a FRBR-based data model called FRIR (for Functional Requirements for Information Resources) for datasets
- the use of abstraction, expressed information, and physical sources is needed to allow members of the community to combine data from different sources and to determine at what level the sources represent the same information
- exact copies of files (the same bitstream) considered items of the same manifestation
