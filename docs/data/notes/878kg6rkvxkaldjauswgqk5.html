<ul>
<li>Accessible vs. inaccessible:  agent’s sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time</li>
<li>Deterministic vs. non-deterministic:  next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the action executed by the agent</li>
<li>Episodic vs. non-episodic:  agent’s experience is divided into atomic episodes, each episode consisting of a perception-action pair where the action is a single action/event</li>
<li>Static vs. dynamic:  environment is unchanged during the agent’s deliberation of an action</li>
<li>Discrete vs. continuous:  limited number of distinct, clearly defined percepts and actions</li>
<li>Single agent:  the agent works in isolation (no other agents around)</li>
</ul>

<p>Reflex Agent
simplest form,  the agent merely reacts to its environment – no memory, no internal states, no planning</p>
<p>State-based Agent
the next step up is an agent that keeps track of its current (and possibly previous) state(s), this can help with planning and understanding</p>
<p>Goal-oriented Agent
this agent has the ability to plan out a sequence of states to achieve in order – planning might be based on a table-lookup approach or something more elaborate using a search mechanism and available planning knowledge</p>
<p>Utility-based Agent
the agent has the ability to determine the usefulness of a plan step toward achieving its goals so that it can achieve the goals in a more optimal fashion, and possibly have better final results for goal</p>
