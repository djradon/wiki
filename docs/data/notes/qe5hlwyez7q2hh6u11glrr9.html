<li>"Our architecture comprises three main components. The first is the memory stream, a long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a comprehensive list of the agent’s experiences. The retrieval model combines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records that are needed to inform the agent’s moment-to-moment behavior. The second is reflection, which synthesizes memories into higher-level inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions about itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is planning, which translates those conclusions and the current environment into high-level action plans and then recursively into detailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and plans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent’s future behavior.</li>
