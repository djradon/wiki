  - Shared Business Logic
    - A semantic layer contains the core logic required for business analysis, transforming the underlying data model into familiar business definitions (dimensions, measures, hierarchies) and easy-to-understand terms. It can contain commonly used derived measures, such as year-over-year, month-over-month, month-to-date, etc. Users can directly consume the calculated measures and reuse the semantics in different downstream applications.

- [[p.hadCallToAction]]
  -  To unleash the power of Hadoop-based data lakes, a semantic layer is needed, and my challenge to The Apache Software Foundation is to start a semantic layer for Hadoop project that will operationally integrate with Apacheâ€™s Hadoop-based data security and governance projects.
