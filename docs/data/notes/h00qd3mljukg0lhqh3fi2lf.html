<p>This is a commentary on the article by Augusto (2022; this issue) on cate- gories and foundation ontology (FO). We agree that the notion of categories of kinds of elements to devise a FO deserves more attention than it has received to date. From a practical point of view sensu developing domain ontologies, however, it probably does not matter much as long as a FO is used and that that one was understood.</p>

<li>A descriptive ontology such as <a href="/wiki/notes/mjcpuwi7bne4r8moc0uruzx">DOLCE</a> allows entities that are dependent on human thoughts and beliefs to be represented while a realist ontology such as <a href="/wiki/notes/u69ohenrjzegyb4ta4bp07j">Basic Formal Ontology</a> aims for the representation of entities that are free of that. </li>
