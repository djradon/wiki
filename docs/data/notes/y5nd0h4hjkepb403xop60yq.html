<p>We propose Object Event Modeling as a new approach to Discrete Event Simulation (DES) engineering and Information Systems (IS) engineering using UML class diagrams for information modeling and BPMN-style process diagrams for process modeling. We consider the case where for a given business system, both a performance analysis is to be conducted with the help of a DES project and an IS is to be constructed with the help of an IS engineering project. Both the DES design model and the IS design model are representations of the same system. We argue that both DES modeling and IS modeling have a substantial overlap and, hence, can learn from each other. While research in DES has focused on events and processes, neglecting objects, IS engineering research has focused on objects, neglecting events.</p>
