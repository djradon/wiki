<p>Many applications operate on time-sensitive data. Some of these data are only valid for certain intervals (e.g., job-assignments, ver- sions of software code), others describe temporal events that happened at certain points in time (e.g., a person’s birthday). Until recently, the only way to incorporate time into Semantic Web models was as a data type property. Temporal RDF, however, considers time as an additional dimension in data preserving the semantics of time. </p>
<p>In this paper we present a syntax and storage format based on named graphs to express temporal RDF. Given the restriction to preexisting RDF-syntax, our approach can perform any temporal query using stan- dard SPARQL syntax only. For convenience, we introduce a shorthand format called τ -SPARQL for temporal queries and show how τ -SPARQL queries can be translated to standard SPARQL. Additionally, we show that, depending on the underlying data’s nature, the temporal RDF ap- proach vastly reduces the number of triples by eliminating redundancies resulting in an increased performance for processing and querying. Last but not least, we introduce a new indexing approach method that can significantly reduce the time needed to execute time point queries (e.g., what happened on January 1st).</p>

<li>SemVersion uses its own data model that contains the user’s ontology and its evolution. Our proposi- tion is not to introduce a new data model, but, storing the elements of the users’ data model inside different named graphs according to their temporal context.</li>

<h3 id="proposed-temporal-syntax">Proposed Temporal Syntax<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#proposed-temporal-syntax"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>As in most of the approaches dealing with temporal entities, we model time as a 1-dimensional discrete value (i.e. no branching time)</li>
<li>we extended OWL- Time with a new date format type called IntegerTime to express non-calendaric time representations such as version numbers.</li>
<li>We refer to a set of temporally related named graphs as a temporal graph. Each time interval is represented by exactly one named graph, where all triples belonging to this graph share the same validity period.</li>
