<li>Although RAML was "created with REST APIs in mind, it’s flexible enough that it can be used to model other architectural styles, including RPC and even GraphQL."</li>
<li>Although RAML focuses on modeling APIs and OAS on describing them, the truth is that either format can be used for either purpose</li>
<li>"“If I had to pick one aspect in which RAML excels, I would say it is the ”re-usability“ aspect. RAML ships with its own type system that helps model data structures using features like inheritance and even multiple inheritance, which helps make schema and API definitions very dry, making them much easier to read (and understand); RAML also has the ”security schemes,“ ”resource types“ and ”traits“ concepts that allow one to model, only once, the most common characteristics of HTTP resources and methods.” – Jonathan Stoikovitch"</li>
