<p>Actually, it’s been three weeks since my first <a href="https://theoldmaninthecave.substack.com/p/lets-reboot-the-semantic-web-with-alternate-realities">dev journal post</a> and <a href="https://djradon.substack.com/p/introducing-carpe-noctem"> general article</a>.</p>
<p>Why so long? Writing those two articles left me a little dazed and daunted. Call it writer’s fatigue. I also wanted to get some technical work worth writing about under my belt. I’ve been going from minus one to zero for long enough already. </p>
<p>So I made some progress on an <a href="/wiki/notes/c5qcd8cate4ic318mkmmkn0">unorthodox foundational ontology</a>.  I'm calling it Kosmion. Anouncement forthcoming, maybe in a week or three. </p>
<p>Progress might’ve been quicker but I’ve been deep in the gopher holes, including a stand-off with the <a href="/wiki/notes/c3cf5t7ybox6k56n992pnkr">“gentle” Unified Foundational Ontology</a>; planning for a <a href="/wiki/notes/ggw3ek46ptgebsgxgihr1dh">semantic static site generator</a>; a review of <a href="/wiki/notes/836unuyt1okg2szo6u8hn1g">Named Graphs</a> and the <a href="/wiki/notes/pi9eqxk27aaedm6ae8tn180">w3c Data Catalog</a> standard; and posting an article <a href="https://theoldmaninthecave.substack.com/p/whats-the-best-semantic-web-authoring">surveying authoring tools for Semantic Web data</a>.</p>

<p>I’d like this dev journal to be somewhat frequent and less engrossing (to write, that is). So I might have to rein in the rumination, lower my standards, and just crank out more updates and <a href="/wiki/notes/9pjzuklc0yn3wsz97x4ybhq">public learnings</a>, goddammit. I can save the over-polishing for my other blog, <a href="/wiki/notes/k8968ewb80th5714d816enb">Carpe Noctem</a>.</p>
<p>If you're curious about Kosmion, I’m posting chats with my tireless synthetic buddy <a href="/wiki/notes/gy0hl5qxmxfesnhnmrr25jr">here</a>.</p>
