<li>yes, continuous and discrete are often arbitrary... it's a continuous spectrum</li>
<li>distributions are important!

<li>e.g. [EuropeanMales haveHeight (Œº=180cm, ùúé=7cm)]</li>
</ul>

<li>Graph Neural Networks contribute a range of important techniques in this conversion to continuous-format knowledge graphs.</li>
<li>Continuous knowledge graphs with entities and relations defined and matched along continuous dimensions as well as triples that have properties and grounding measured on continuous scales are a natural fit for mathematical and probabilistic modeling. And an exciting next step to take us beyond the straitjacket of two-valued logic and binary variables that people mistakenly associate with non-numeric knowledge.</li>
