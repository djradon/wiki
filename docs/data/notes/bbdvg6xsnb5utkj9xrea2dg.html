</blockquote>
<p>Well, I just used the invited talk to give my speech on this topic,<br>
but here's a more concrete list. I reserve the right to think of more<br>
tomorrow.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clean up and simplify RDF abstract syntax. Literals can be<br>
subjects, properties can be blank nodes, etc. In fact, anything can be<br>
anything in the triple space, in the conceptual graph model. The<br>
existing semantics can handle this without change. The spec gets to be<br>
shorter and easier.
1a. All literals are typed, plain literals are understood in<br>
retrospect to be an abbreviation for typing with rdf:text.
1b. If XMLLiteral is necessary, make it into an ordinary datatype. Or<br>
get rid of it altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A better syntax than RDF/XML. I also like turtle or N3 style, but<br>
whatever, striped syntax is just too remote from the actual graph<br>
model to be useful, and it imposes subtle and harmful influence over<br>
the whole language (eg it was why we don't have literals as<br>
subjects.)  FWIW, this is likely to be the hardest problem for<br>
backward compatibility, I suspect. I wonder how hard it would be to<br>
have a converter from RDF/XML into some other form, as a W3C service?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a scope mechanism to the syntax, along the lines of the<br>
'surfaces' idea in my talk. (Terminology and exact syntax for this can<br>
be adjusted to suit, but parentheses work well :-) This is an<br>
extension to the current model, existing RDF documents are understood<br>
to be on a document-level surface that was always there. As well as<br>
making bnodes respectable, this provides a clean foundation for a<br>
whole lot of other things, including:
3a. named surfaces (aka named graphs)
3b. negation (see my ISWC talk) and hence full FOL as a natural and<br>
well-understood extension (without any retro changes to existing RDF)<br>
This is close to my heart, but not of immediate priority: Im more<br>
concerned that nothing is done which would break this as a future<br>
pathway.
3c. NAF negation. I didn't go into this in the talk, but the big<br>
problem with any kind of nonmon reasoning on the Web is that nonmon<br>
(notably NAF) only works inside fixed boundaries, and so far we don't<br>
have a way to draw the boundaries. Scoped surfaces give us this, and<br>
so we could have for example 'closed' surfaces which support NAF<br>
reasoning, and the whole logic can then be monotonic. Best of both<br>
worlds, and IMO a better solution that the RIF idea of multiple<br>
logical 'zones' with conflicting semantics. Though it would be<br>
straightforward to link it to the RIF spec, I am pretty sure (the idea<br>
would be, for RIF, that it takes its logic-zone cue from the 'color'<br>
of the surface it finds the rules on. All written in RDF, of course :-)
3d. Named surfaces provide better mechanism than reification for RDF-
metadata-of-other-RDF (It is token level rather than abstract graph<br>
level, which suddenly makes sense.)
3e. Cleaner model for such things as unasserted annotations in OWL,<br>
use of RDF collections to encode OWL syntax, etc.., where some of the<br>
RDF isn't really being, like, asserted, exactly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deprecate RDF reification, containers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(related to 4) Choose a recommended way to encode n-ary relations,<br>
explain it fully, and deprecate all the others. Or, generalize RDF<br>
triples to n-tuples syntax, with the previous as a backward<br>
compatibility hack for old RDF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a clean version of SKOS into RDF, to replace RDFS. Current<br>
RDFS is then OK but deprecated in favor of translation into newer<br>
vocabulary, eg you should actually say that you want subclass/property<br>
to be transitive, when you do. In the semantics, this is done by<br>
changing various 'iff's to 'if's, making reasoning searches easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include a modern, nuanced version of owl:imports into RDF. Should<br>
be possible to import only a part of a large ontology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related to 6 &#x26; 7: provide some vocabulary and guidance for how to<br>
link RDF data without falling into the owl:sameAs black hole. Note, we<br>
won't completely solve this, but even a beginning would be a huge<br>
improvement over the current situation, and this should be done at the<br>
RDF level rather than a forest of conflicting conventions growing into<br>
use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide some way (an RDF vocabulary?) to support versioning,<br>
deprecation, etc., if only some best practice recommendations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
