- datasets across multiple repos can have IRIs detected for them, so the namespace repo is a top down "which datasets to download and scan for contained IRIs"
- can either be root (correspond to github username or org name, e.g. djradon.github.io) or 2nd-level (corresponding to an owned repo)

## Questions

- should repos be able to include HTML templates and entity-to-template mappings?
  - yes? but can be overridden at the namespace repo
