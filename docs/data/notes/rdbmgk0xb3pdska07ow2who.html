<p>OntoGrapher is one software tool among many in a toolkit known as the Assembly Line, which serves as a software suite supporting creation, management, evaluation, and publishing of vocabularies - currently for, but not theoretically limited to, those vocabularies containing terms from a legal domain. In particular, OntoGrapher has the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>offering a web-based collaborative conceptual modeling environment for domain experts,</li>
<li>accepting SKOS terminologies on input and producing OWL ontologies on output without requiring users to understand either of these standards,</li>
<li>tracking the source of entities, relations and attributes in conceptual models stemming from multiple vocabularies (e.g. laws).</li>
<li></li>
