<h2 id="the-flexibility-of-cmmn-is-attractive-for-modeling-rpg-style-games-but-visual-only-notation-seems-imprecise-and-impractical-is-there-a-textual-alternative">the flexibility of cmmn is attractive for modeling RPG-style games, but visual-only notation seems imprecise and impractical. is there a textual alternative?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-flexibility-of-cmmn-is-attractive-for-modeling-rpg-style-games-but-visual-only-notation-seems-imprecise-and-impractical-is-there-a-textual-alternative"></a></h2>
<p>CMMN (Case Management Model and Notation) is indeed a powerful tool for modeling flexible and non-deterministic workflows, such as those found in RPG-style games. However, as you've identified, its visual notation can be imprecise and impractical for certain use cases. For those seeking a more textual or code-based approach, there are a few alternatives and strategies you might consider:</p>
<h3 id="1-cmmn-xml-representation">1. <strong>CMMN XML Representation</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#1-cmmn-xml-representation"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Textual Format</strong>: While CMMN is often used with graphical tools, it is inherently based on XML. You can directly author or manipulate CMMN models using XML, which provides a textual, precise, and version-controllable way to define cases.</li>
<li><strong>Tooling Support</strong>: Many CMMN-compliant tools allow you to export and edit CMMN models as XML files. This gives you the ability to define your models textually, though it requires familiarity with the XML schema of CMMN.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-declarative-workflow-languages">2. <strong>Declarative Workflow Languages</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-declarative-workflow-languages"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Declarative Languages</strong>: If you are looking for flexibility similar to CMMN but with a focus on textual representation, declarative workflow languages like <strong><a href="/notes/rrvbpmq9y9myt2kk6jodt98">Declare</a></strong> (or languages inspired by it) might be of interest. Declare is designed for specifying constraints rather than fixed sequences of tasks, which aligns well with the flexibility of RPG scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: These languages offer a balance between flexibility and precision, allowing you to define rules and constraints textually while maintaining the non-deterministic nature of the workflows.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-drools-rule-engine">3. <strong>Drools Rule Engine</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#3-drools-rule-engine"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rules-Based Approach</strong>: Using a rules engine like <strong>Drools</strong> allows you to define complex conditions and actions in a textual format. This can be particularly powerful for RPG-style games where game states and outcomes can be managed through a set of rules rather than a predefined workflow.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with BPM</strong>: Drools integrates well with BPM engines, allowing you to combine the flexibility of rules with more structured workflows.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-scripting-languages-in-game-engines">4. <strong>Scripting Languages in Game Engines</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#4-scripting-languages-in-game-engines"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Scripting</strong>: Many RPG-style games use custom scripting languages (e.g., Lua, Python) embedded within game engines to define the flow of gameplay. These languages can offer the same flexibility as CMMN but with the added benefit of being tailored to game development.</li>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: Scripting languages offer precise control over game mechanics, are highly flexible, and can easily integrate with other game components.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-textual-modeling-languages-tml">5. <strong>Textual Modeling Languages (TML)</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#5-textual-modeling-languages-tml"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Textual DSLs</strong>: Some modeling tools offer Textual DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages) that provide the power of models with the flexibility of code. These DSLs allow you to define workflows, rules, and cases in a textual format that can be transformed into executable models.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Xtext is a framework that allows you to create textual DSLs for various domains, including workflow modeling. This approach could be customized to reflect CMMN-like flexibility while maintaining the precision of textual notation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-business-process-model-and-notation-bpmn-with-extensions">6. <strong>Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) with Extensions</strong>:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#6-business-process-model-and-notation-bpmn-with-extensions"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Textual BPMN</strong>: BPMN itself can be represented in XML and manipulated textually. Additionally, some tools allow for extensions to BPMN that can capture more dynamic, case-like behavior while still using a textual format.</li>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: This approach leverages the widespread tooling and support for BPMN while introducing the flexibility needed for more dynamic scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#conclusion"></a></h3>
<p>For RPG-style game modeling, where flexibility is crucial, using a declarative language like <strong>Declare</strong>, a rules-based approach with <strong>Drools</strong>, or even custom scripting in game engines may be more suitable than relying on visual CMMN notation alone. These options offer the textual precision you’re looking for, combined with the flexibility needed for complex, non-linear workflows.</p>
<p>If you still prefer to stay within the CMMN ecosystem, directly working with <strong>CMMN XML</strong> provides a more hands-on, text-based approach to defining your models.</p>
<h2 id="has-anyone-done-an-owl-ontology-for-cmmn-concepts">has anyone done an OWL ontology for CMMN concepts?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#has-anyone-done-an-owl-ontology-for-cmmn-concepts"></a></h2>
<p>It seems that no comprehensive OWL ontology specifically for CMMN (Case Management Model and Notation) concepts has been widely adopted or documented. While there are tools and research efforts aimed at integrating CMMN with other semantic technologies, a dedicated OWL ontology capturing the full range of CMMN concepts appears to be a niche or yet-to-be-developed area.</p>
<p>However, creating such an ontology is feasible and could be beneficial for projects requiring semantic interoperability between case management systems and other ontological frameworks. If you're considering this, you might need to start from the foundational concepts of CMMN and build an ontology that captures the core elements such as cases, stages, tasks, milestones, and sentries, possibly extending existing business process ontologies.</p>
<p>For existing tools, you may find partial mappings or semantic annotations in tools like Trisotech or other business process modeling environments that could serve as a starting point.</p>
