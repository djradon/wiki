<li>"Moreover, OWL is rooted in first-order logic, which becomes inadequate when modeling complex systems such as systems-of-systems. In these contexts, higher-order logics are needed — for instance, to reason about sets of sets or meta-relationships. This has led to the use of alternative frameworks such as UML (used in the IDEAS ontology) and OntoUML, which offer richer semantic constructs for conceptual modeling."</li>
<li>"most major upper ontologies — such as SUMO, DOLCE, and BFO — are not mutually compatible. While they provide useful abstract categories (e.g., events, qualities, parts), their differences have hindered widespread integration."</li>
<li>Toward Polyglot Hypermodeling: One concrete example is the ArchiCG experiment, which explores how ArchiMate models can be represented as OWL ontologies, UML diagrams, or compound graphs rooted in graph/network theory. These representations are synchronized to preserve semantic integrity while enabling different forms of analysis, visualization, or integration.</li>
