<li>Conceptual modeling is of great importance not only to Information Systems and Software Engineering, but also to Simulation Engineering. It is concerned with identifying, analyzing and describing the essen- tial concepts and constraints of a real-world domain with the help of a (diagrammatic) modeling language that is based on a set of basic modeling concepts (forming a metamodel). In this tutorial, we introduce the ontologically well-founded conceptual modeling language Onto-UML and show how to use it for making conceptual simulation models as the basis of model-driven simulation engineering.</li>

<p>Two most important viewpoints:</p>
<ol>
<li>information modeling, which is concerned with the state structure of the domain;</li>
<li>process modeling, which is concerned with the dynamics of the domain.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It is natural to apply the general methodology of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) also to sim-
ulation engineering.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the results obtained in the conceptual modeling field of IS&#x26;SE have largely been
ignored in M&#x26;S. Still today, conceptual modeling is often confused with design modeling in
M&#x26;S.</li>
<li>A conceptual model is a solution-independent description of a problem domain expressed in a
well-defined (diagrammatic) modeling language.</li>
<li>In model-driven simulation engineering, we first make a conceptual system model, from which
we derive a (platform-independent) simulation design model, which is then transformed into one
or more (platform-specific) simulation models.</li>
<li>A conceptual modeling language is a representation of a meta-conceptualization of a viewpoint
of the real world. A system conceptualization, which exists in the mind of the modeler and con-
tains a number of system concepts, instantiates a meta-conceptualization. It is represented in the
form of a conceptual system model expressed in the conceptual modeling language representing
the meta-conceptualization.</li>
<li>We propose to use improved variants of UML Class Diagrams and BPMN, which are based on a
foundational ontology, for conceptual information and process modeling</li>
