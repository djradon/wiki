<li>"The concrete syntax of a language is its syntax in its representation that we see. The XML and custom language files have different concrete syntaxes. However both share the same basic structure: you have multiple mappings, each with a code, a target class name, and a set of fields. This basic structure is the abstract syntax. When most developers think about programming language syntax they don't make this separation, but it's an important one when you use DSLs. You can think of this in two ways. You can either say we have one language with two concrete syntaxes, or two languages that share the same abstract syntax."
