<pre><code>C++: C++ is one of the most well-known languages that supports multiple inheritance. It allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes, and it uses a combination of virtual inheritance and access specifiers to handle potential issues like the diamond problem.

Python: Python supports multiple inheritance, and it uses a method resolution order (MRO) algorithm called C3 Linearization to determine the order in which methods are inherited from multiple base classes. This helps avoid ambiguities and the diamond problem.

Eiffel: Eiffel is a statically typed object-oriented language that supports multiple inheritance through its "multi-parent" mechanism, allowing a class to have multiple parents.

Perl: Perl, a dynamic programming language, supports multiple inheritance. It allows classes to inherit from multiple base classes, and the order in which base classes are used is determined by the order in which they are listed.

Common Lisp: Common Lisp, a dialect of Lisp, supports multiple inheritance using its CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) with the defclass and :metaclass options.

Ruby: Ruby supports multiple inheritance, although it employs a single inheritance mechanism by allowing a class to inherit from one class while including modules that provide additional behavior. This is a form of mixin-based multiple inheritance.
