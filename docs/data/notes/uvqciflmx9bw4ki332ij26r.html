<p>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR &#x26; R) has become one of the promising fields of Artificial Intelligence. KR is dedicated towards representing information about the domain that can be utilized in path planning. Ontology based knowledge representation and reasoning techniques provide sophisticated knowledge about the environment for processing tasks or methods. Ontology helps in representing the knowledge about environment, events and actions that help in path planning and making robots more autonomous. Knowledge reasoning techniques can infer new conclusion and thus aids planning dynamically in a non-deterministic environment. In the initial sections, the representation of knowledge using ontology and the techniques for reasoning that could contribute in path planning are discussed in detail. In the following section, we also provide comparison of various planning domain modeling languages, ontology editors, planners and robot simulation tools.</p>
