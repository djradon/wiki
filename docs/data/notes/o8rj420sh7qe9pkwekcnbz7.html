<li>I decided to experiment with writing all metadata in RDF and using a SPARQL query to generate the necessary static web pages. For fun.</li>
<li><a href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/queryable-research-data/">Ruben Verborgh has written a nice article</a> about embedding metadata within webpages using RDFa and using an ETL pipeline to extract that metadata and do fun stuff with it - like querying, reasoning, and figuring out where the data and the metadata should live. Much of this work is inspired from Ruben's, and that of <a href="https://csarven.ca/how-to-create-a-linked-data-site">Sarven's website building approach</a>. After I had already completed work on my site, I found out about  which takes a similar approach for providing an API and views over existing RDF data, and which <a href="http://sabrinakirrane.com/">Sabrina</a> uses to manage her academic website.</li>
