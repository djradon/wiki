<p><strong>Improvisational theater</strong> (often called <strong>improv</strong>) is a form of theater where most or all of the performance is <strong>unscripted</strong> and created spontaneously by the actors. The performers typically invent dialogue, characters, and plotlines on the spot, often based on audience suggestions. The key is creativity, quick thinking, and collaboration.</p>
