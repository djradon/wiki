## Highlights

- for more complex models, sequential ([[t.cs.simulation.discrete-event]]) simulation will exhibit poor runtime performance (compared to [[t.cs.agents.agent-based-simulation]])
- " our choice of employing [[prdct.dolce]] as foundational ontology was motivated by the need to enable agents to adapt their conceptualizations and create new ones on the fly because several dedicated DOLCE-modules provide a corresponding framework"
- we have chosen to employ a set of ontological modules which have been designed along with the DOLCE framework, namely:
- the [[prdct.ontology-of-information-objects]];
- the [[prdct.ontology-of-plans]] **
- the Core Software Ontology [29]
- the Descriptions and Situations module [13].
