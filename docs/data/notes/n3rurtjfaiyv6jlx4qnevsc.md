## Features

- "AML enables you to formally describe different kinds of models, whether syntactic modelsâ€”specific to languages or specifications-or semantic models specific to industries and domains."
- "a.ml: Anything Modeling Language... which targets mapping of YAML schemas to ontologies and SHACL shapes, and YAML documents to RDF graphs."

## Terms

Dialect
: defines a set of constraints over a RDF data-model composed by a graph of nodes connected by properties. All node types and properties have associated terms that must have been defined in a AML Vocabulary. Additionally, the AML Dialect also defines a mapping of this nodes over a set of modular documents (including partial definitions encoded in fragments and libraries of reusable components), that encode a mapping function capable of transforming document instances of the dialect encoded in YAML or JSON documents into RDF graphs encoded in JSON-LD documents.

Vocabulary
: a mechanism to describe any domain of discourse using familiar YAML syntax and modular documents.
