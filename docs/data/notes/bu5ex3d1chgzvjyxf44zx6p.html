<p>Dogg3rz leverages a combination of W3C standards and common cloud native services in conjunction with emergent Web 3 Technologies. The JSON-LD document is used as a representational data model for linked data; whereas <a href="/wiki/notes/7j4g7bp0ffb8mzmw377kezs">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) serve as self-sovereign, globally unique, and verifiable identifiers for the data products and those who use them. Dogg3rz uses container and Serverless technologies to apply reactive behavior to your data . The final packaging, delivery, and streaming update notifications of your linked data product are performed by the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS encapsulates and persists your linked data product components through an immutable snapshot that can be referenced and used anywhere through its verifiable content identifiers (CIDs).</p>
