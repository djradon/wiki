<p>"-   Roles: In an SCM, the committer is the crucial role. While SCMs recognize the difference between author and committer, in practice, this is usually of little importance. For a dataset, however, authorship, i.e., the exact source of datasets, is of greater importance, and many other roles are relevant and should be differentiable, such as data processors (people or systems that transform, clean, or enrich raw data), data curators (experts who organize, categorize, and enrich data with metadata), data protection officers, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of metadata: Datasets often require extensive metadata (e.g., origin, license, timestamps) that are not natively supported in SCMs.</li>
<li>Granularity of changes: SCMs often work at the file level, while for datasets, individual records or fields may be relevant.</li>
<li>Database integration: DCMs should ideally be able to interact directly with database systems, which is not provided for in SCMs."</li>
