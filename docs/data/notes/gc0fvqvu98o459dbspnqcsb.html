Okay, so while we're playing this demo to see how it works, we need to have Polygon (and MATIC tokens) for the Emergence avatar side of things, and the L1 Betanet and L1 Betanet tokens for the trophy minting, is that correct?
Aleissia
‚Äî
Today at 9:41 AM
Yes that is correct. Neither are musts but there's 2 mint options in this project: </p>
<pre><code>L1 will allow you to mint the L1 Trophy.
Matic will allow you to mint your own VRM Avatar. So you can test out the whole flow of then having an avatar tied to your persona.
</code></pre>
<p>As a note, if ever you have another NFT Avatar you would love to use, we can help you get that setup, if it isn't already registered in our Emergence Avatar System.

Awesome, that makes a lot of sense (and gives me something to do to troubleshoot the issue I was having with the Unity demo).  I presume that we could retool the avatar system so that it works on the Lamina1 blockchain (provided that we either provide, or there is present, a comparable contract on Lamina1)?  I know this would not make it work across the whole Emergence ecosystem, but I'm just thinking of ways to keep things simple for Lamina1 users (to keep everything within the Lamina1 network, and users needing only the one token).

Unity and Unreal are meant to be feature parity, a few additional features today in Unreal but goal is to get to full feature parity for Emergence.</p>

Q: for dynamic metadata, would this be a seperate layer of metadata that can applied to already existing NFT collections?  and this layer of metadata would not be on chain?  i.e. used specifically for in-game logic**</p>
<p>follow up:  would there be a way to allow this dynamic metadata to be written and thus change an NFT's actual on chain metadata?  like it's artwork or a type of metadata that is already on chain?</p>

There are some interesting ways to do this by wrapping existing NFTs to extend functionality. It raises questions about who is allowed to extend functionality and how to use that functionality which we're working on
Aleissia
‚Äî
Today at 10:06 AM
Great question! </p>
<p>As of right now, this is a way to add additional metadata to NFT collections. That is currently saved off-chain with using all the authentication / etc of what the owner of the NFT sets for it. </p>
<p>We are also building out standard templates so NEW nft creators can utilize that as well. </p>
<p>Goal is to be allow any creator / developer to treat an NFT like a game object. Read/Write based on the permissions the owner sets.
