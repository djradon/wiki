<li>The plugin supports many features that allow it to be used in many more contexts than just basic audio conferencing, though. For instance, it supports the playback of static audio streams along actual participants, and allows for plain-RTP participants to join in the conversation as well (thus not limiting it to WebRTC only attendees). Most importantly, it allows for the real-time audio mix to be sent to an external component in real-time, which allows for many additional use cases (scalable distribution, live transcriptions, audio processing, etc.).</li>
