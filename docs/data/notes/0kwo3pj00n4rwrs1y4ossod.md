## Description

- each **type**(?) of linked data fragment (including triple pattern fragments) is defined by
  - data
  - metadata
  - controls (how to access more data)

## Examples

- data dumps (example): their selector is the universal selector, their metadata set includes the file size, and their control set is empty.

- subject pages (example): their selector is a subject URI, their metadata set is often empty, and their control set is given by URIs that can be dereferenced.

- SPARQL results (example): their selector is a CONSTRUCT query, their metadata set is empty, and their control set includes the endpoint URI, which allows to retrieve other SPARQL results.
