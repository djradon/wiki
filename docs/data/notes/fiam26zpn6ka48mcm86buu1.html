<p>We follow what has been implemented in mOWL that uses JPype to bridge Python and Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Please check JPype's installation page for successful JVM initialisation.

<h2 id="features">Features<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#features"></a></h2>
<p>Ontology Reasoning ([OntologyReasoner][deeponto.onto.OntologyReasoner]): Each instance of DeepOnto has a reasoner as its attribute. It is used for conducting reasoning activities, such as obtaining inferred subsumers and subsumees, as well as checking entailment and consistency.</p>
<p>Ontology Pruning ([OntologyPruner][deeponto.onto.OntologyPruner]): This sub-module aims to incorporate pruning algorithms for extracting a sub-ontology from an input ontology. We currently implement the one proposed in [2], which introduces subsumption axioms between the asserted (atomic or complex) parents and children of the class targeted for removal.</p>
<p>Ontology Verbalisation ([OntologyVerbaliser][deeponto.onto.OntologyVerbaliser]): The recursive concept verbaliser proposed in [4] is implemented here, which can automatically transform a complex logical expression into a textual sentence based on entity names or labels available in the ontology. See verbalising ontology concepts.</p>
<p>Ontology Projection ([OntologyProjector][deeponto.onto.OntologyProjector]): The projection algorithm adopted in the OWL2Vec* ontology embeddings is implemented here, which is to transform an ontology's TBox into a set of RDF triples. The relevant code is modified from the mOWL library.</p>
<p>Ontology Normalisation ([OntologyNormaliser][deeponto.onto.OntologyNormaliser]): The implemented</p>
<p>normalisation is also modified from the mOWL library, which is used to transform TBox axioms into normalised forms to support, e.g., geometric ontology embeddings.</p>
<p>Ontology Taxonomy ([OntologyTaxonomy][deeponto.onto.OntologyTaxonomy]): The taxonomy extracted from an ontology is a directed acyclic graph for the subsumption hierarchy, which is often used to support graph-based deep learning applications.</p>
