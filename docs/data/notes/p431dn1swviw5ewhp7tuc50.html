<p>This report is a living document of the Research Group Ontologies in Medicine (Onto-Med) which represents work in progress towards a proposal for an integrated system of foundational ontologies. It will be applied to several fields of medicine, biomedicine, and biology, and a number of applications are carried out in collaboration with the Center for Clinical Trials at the University of Leipzig, with the Max Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and with the ICCAS at the University of Leipzig. The General Formal Ontology (GFO) is a component of the Integrated System of Foundational Ontologies (ISFO), and ISFO is a part of the Integrated Framework for the Development and Application of Ontologies (IFDAO). The predecessor of IFDAO was the GOL project which was launched in 1999 as a collaborative research effort of the Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology (IMISE) and the Institute of Informatics (IfI) at the University of Leipzig.</p>

<p>The psychological stratum has its own structure, it is associated to subjects, sometimes called (particularly in the field of artificial intelligence) agents. We assume that psychological/mental entities have no independent existence, but they are founded on/in material objects. Mental entities emerge out of biological entities and it is an open problem where the borderline should be drawn between material and mental entities. We assume that every human agent has a mental level that divides into two basic components, one is called awareness, the other personality. Awareness is comprised mostly of cognitive science subjects, such as perception, memory, and reasoning. Personality, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with the phenomenon of will, and an individualsâ€™s reaction on her experience. The mental level of a human agent is not isolated from the material world, there is a direct interaction between a human agent and the outside world; this interaction is mediated mainly by perception and the <a href="/wiki/notes/ag00v023rltebu4g91u79db">phenomenal objects</a> constructed out of them. We call these phenomenal objects intermediate entities, they may be put to/on the side of the material stratum. Phenomenal objects can be understood as dispositions of physical objects that come to appearence in the mental level of an individual subject.</p>
<p>These phenomenal entities are the individuals of the medioscopic material stratum that was described and investigated in the preceding sections of the report. Phenomenal individuals constitute the basic for every higher order activities of the mind, for memory, reasoning, language, and communication.</p>
