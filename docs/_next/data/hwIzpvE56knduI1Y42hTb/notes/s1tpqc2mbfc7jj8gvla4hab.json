In your case, <strong>\"Department class\"</strong> at <strong>M2</strong> does not generalize or define a hierarchy of subclasses (like HR Department or Finance Department); instead, it defines <strong>what it means to be a department class</strong>. The <strong>HR Department (M1)</strong> is not a subclass but an <strong>instance</strong> of the meta-class \"Department class\" at M2.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: \"Department class\" would define characteristics or constraints of department <strong>classes</strong> (like <strong>HR Department</strong> or <strong>Finance Department</strong>) at M1, but it would not generalize these departments as a superclass would.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Superclass (Same level)</strong>: A <strong>superclass</strong> exists at the <strong>same level</strong> of abstraction as its subclasses and generalizes them.

This would classify any department class at <strong>M1</strong>, such as <strong>HR Department</strong> or <strong>Finance Department</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: \n<ul>\n<li><strong>Department type</strong> (M2): Class that defines department types.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>M1 - \"Generic Department\" Superclass (Type Hierarchy)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At <strong>M1</strong>, you can introduce a <strong>\"Generic Department\" superclass</strong>, which generalizes specific kinds of departments like <strong>HR Department</strong>, <strong>Finance Department</strong>, etc. This is part of a <strong>type hierarchy</strong> within the M1 level.</li>\n<li>This allows you to organize specific department classes within a hierarchy for shared properties (such as departments having employees, budgets, etc.).</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Generic Department</strong> (Superclass at M1): Generalizes common properties for all departments.</li>\n<li><strong>HR Department</strong>, <strong>Finance Department</strong> (Subclasses at M1): Inherit from <strong>Generic Department</strong> and add specific characteristics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>M0 - Real Instances</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At <strong>M0</strong>, you have specific <strong>instances</strong> of departments like <strong>\"HR Department of Company X\"</strong>, which are instances of <strong>HR Department (M1)</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>HR Department of Company X</strong> (M0): An instance of <strong>HR Department</strong> at M1.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"power-of-combining-type-hierarchy-and-meta-hierarchy\">Power of Combining Type Hierarchy and Meta-Hierarchy:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#power-of-combining-type-hierarchy-and-meta-hierarchy\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>By introducing a <strong>type hierarchy</strong> at M1, you can still benefit from <strong>inheritance</strong> and shared properties between different department types (through the <strong>Generic Department superclass</strong>). This allows you to avoid redundancy and manage common behaviors or attributes across specific department types.</li>\n<li>Meanwhile, the <strong>meta-hierarchy</strong> ensures that you can manage the classification of different <strong>department classes</strong> (like <strong>HR Department</strong> and <strong>Finance Department</strong>) through the <strong>Department type (M2)</strong>. This provides flexibility and abstraction across different meta-levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"example-breakdown\">Example Breakdown:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#example-breakdown\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>M2 - Department type class</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defines what it means to be a department type.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>M1 - Generic Department superclass</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generalizes properties of all department types, such as having employees, a budget, and objectives.</li>\n<li>Specific subclasses, like <strong>HR Department</strong> and <strong>Finance Department</strong>, inherit from <strong>Generic Department</strong> and specialize those properties.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>M0 - Real-World Instances</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instances like <strong>HR Department of Company X</strong> or <strong>Finance Department of Company Y</strong> exist at the real-world level.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion-2\">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#conclusion-2\"></a></h3>\n<p>This structure works well for combining the strengths of a <strong>type hierarchy</strong> at M1 with a <strong>meta-hierarchy</strong> at M2. You get the benefit of generalization and inheritance at the class level while keeping clear distinctions between meta-levels. This makes your model both flexible and scalable, allowing you to handle different types of departments efficiently across different levels of abstraction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"itd-be-nice-to-be-able-to-visualize-this-clearly-but-it-feels-like-youd-need-a-3d-visualization-one-axis-for-meta-hierarchy-and-then-two-axes-for-any-contained-type-hierarchies-i-was-also-thinking-likec4-could-be-a-good-tool-with-its-multi-level-capabilities\">It'd be nice to be able to visualize this clearly, but it feels like you'd need a 3D visualization... one axis for meta-hierarchy, and then two axes for any contained type hierarchies. I was also thinking likeC4 could be a good tool, with it's multi-level capabilities.<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#itd-be-nice-to-be-able-to-visualize-this-clearly-but-it-feels-like-youd-need-a-3d-visualization-one-axis-for-meta-hierarchy-and-then-two-axes-for-any-contained-type-hierarchies-i-was-also-thinking-likec4-could-be-a-good-tool-with-its-multi-level-capabilities\"></a></h2>\n<p>You’re absolutely right that <strong>visualizing multi-level models</strong> with both meta-hierarchy and type hierarchies can be complex, and a 3D approach could indeed help clarify the relationships.</p>\n<h3 id=\"visualization-idea\">Visualization Idea:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#visualization-idea\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meta-Hierarchy Axis</strong>: This could be the vertical axis, representing different levels of abstraction (e.g., M0 for instances, M1 for classes, M2 for meta-classes, and so on).</li>\n<li><strong>Type Hierarchy Axes</strong>: The other two axes could represent relationships within each level, showing inheritance and specialization among entities (like a type hierarchy for specific departments within the M1 level).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"c4-as-a-tool\">C4 as a Tool:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#c4-as-a-tool\"></a></h3>\n<p>The <strong>C4 model</strong> (Context, Container, Component, Code) could indeed be useful for visualizing your multi-level model because it’s designed to handle multi-level systems and relationships. C4 is especially good at representing <strong>architectural relationships</strong> across different levels of abstraction. Although it’s often used in software architecture, you could potentially adapt its multi-level capabilities for your modeling needs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context Level (C4)</strong>: Could represent the broader system or domain context.</li>\n<li><strong>Container/Component Levels (C4)</strong>: Could represent specific departments or organizational units and how they relate within the meta- and type hierarchies.</li>\n<li><strong>Code Level (C4)</strong>: Could represent specific real-world instances (like an individual HR department).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3d-visualization-tools\">3D Visualization Tools:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#3d-visualization-tools\"></a></h3>\n<p>If you’re thinking about creating a truly 3D visualization, you might consider tools that allow for <strong>graph-based modeling</strong> with 3D space:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Neo4j (with 3D rendering)</strong>: Great for relationships and hierarchies, though typically used for graph databases.</li>\n<li><strong>Gephi</strong>: A network visualization tool that could be adapted to multi-dimensional models.</li>\n<li><strong>Blender or Three.js</strong>: For custom 3D modeling if you want complete control over visualization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion-3\">Conclusion:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#conclusion-3\"></a></h3>\n<p>Your idea of using a 3D visualization (with axes for meta-hierarchy and type hierarchies) makes a lot of sense, especially for complex, layered systems like multi-level models. Adapting tools like <strong>C4</strong> for its multi-level capabilities or even exploring 3D visualization options could give you the clarity and insight needed to represent both the abstraction and type relationships effectively.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"CpS9sdQeO83XthdjEzqoL","title":"djradon's
