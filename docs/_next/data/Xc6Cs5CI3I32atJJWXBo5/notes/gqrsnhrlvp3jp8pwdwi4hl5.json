class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#abstract\"></a></h2>\n<p>In this thesis, an ontology is introduced to model theories for the description and representation of literary characters. Thereby, individual comprehensions of characters by readers are put in focus. To give examples, mostly devil characters derived from different Faust works are described in the ontology. Briefly, several theories of literary characters are combined to create a base of a formal description using an OWL ontology. Here, categories, which describe features and actions of characters mentioned in stories had to be adapted and applied. It is aimed at representing the mental information structure of a reader, which (s)he has in mind when reading a book. Categories describing general aspects of literary characters form the main classes of the ontology, e.g. inner and outer features, actions on subjects and objects. By using sub classes, categories can subsume features of special characters or groups of characters. In addition, so-called instances of the classes represent individual and explicit objects of the domain of literary characters. Here, direct information about a character given in a text is assigned to an instance. Together with the information of the class hierarchy and other instances, a single mental representation of a character is modelled. Different applications have been developed to explore possibilities of the ontology. Even on such a specific ontology, it is possible to apply logic reasoning using Racer and Prolog. But by using these applications, one was faced with problems: queries of logic reasoning can only make implicit information explicit and more individual queries, which cannot be expressed by logic constructs, cannot be retrieved. Nevertheless, one can imagine that logic reasoning is useful for approaches, which intend a usage and retrieval more by machines than by human beings. Furthermore, two applications have been developed to give access to the ontology. A client-server system is introduced to manipulate the ontology, to search and to compare mental representations of literary characters. The system presents a platform for the discussion and access of representations of characters. The inclusion of new subcategories and information about characters as well as different retrievals and comparisons are the core of this system. Results are mostly presented by different visualisations of character representations. This system can support comparisons of literary characters in an essential way. The second application is a method to add semi-automatically instances to the ontology. This approach aims at users well trained in text encoding but who do not have insides into ontologies. In addition, it is worked on reducing the sometimes labour-intensive work of manual insertion of a representation of a character. A TEI encoding scheme was adapted to enable automated parsing of the text and to produce assignments where the different instances might be included into the class hierarchy of the ontology. The user has just to confirm or select a different class. On the basis of derived character representations included in the ontology, the devil characters of the example corpus were analysed and compared to each other taking advantage of the developed client-server system. By using automatically generated histograms of the distribution of instances for certain classes and visualised representations of the characters, it was possible to examine them in detail and to detect similarities and differences. Regarding the literary analysis, a huge development from the first characters until the later ones can be shown. Devil characters become main and modern characters, which means that they can also vary and can be contradictory in their features and motivations. This development takes place independently from the genre. The choice of the genre depends on the single author, but it seems that they each adopted conceptions from different genres. Observed similarities support the assumption of a traditional core of a devil's conception. Although the conceptions vary, it seems that variations are restricted to a specific frame. In summary, one can state that the ontology is an appropriate method to provide structured overviews of characters, observe different representations, and to find information about characters easily, also in the texts, if references are included. By using the mental representations stored in the ontology, it is possible to clarify aspects and to preserve opinions about characters. Although the ontology is restricted in flexible handling of information and can only present things which are included at a particular date, here, it can illustrate mental representations of characters. By using this ontology, the result of a reading process can be shown, but not directly the action of reading and its different states. This approach demonstrates the possibilities and advantages for literature studies if combined with computer-aided approaches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"highlights\">Highlights<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#highlights\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"approaches-to-description-and-classification-of-characters\">Approaches to Description and Classification of Characters<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#approaches-to-description-and-classification-of-characters\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>simple-to-complex</li>\n<li>typical/stereotypical features</li>\n<li>roles of characters concerning the plot </li>\n<li>by genre</li>\n<li>cognitive-orieted approaches (attaching the process of reading and reception of characters)\n<ul>\n<li>\"Characters are not anymore just the\npersons in fiction, but a complex of letters and sense in a reader’s mind.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"survey-of-theories-of-literary-characters\">Survey of Theories of Literary Characters<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#survey-of-theories-of-literary-characters\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/ip8s8aoyqxhkgto82d032yq\">@vladimir-propp</a>’s theory is an important precursor for the perspective known as <a href=\"/wiki/notes/tnfpj946pt9avh01q1xav2y\">Structuralism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/iy4uhnx9ijzj4ooc264nlaw\">@edward-morgan-forster</a> groups literary characters as “flat” or “round”.\n<ul>\n<li>flat: few features and consisting of a simple structure</li>\n<li>round: more complex and have more Information\n<ul>\n<li>can be modified during the plot, so it might be difficult to describe it briefly</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/4qaaoyqo9th2zt6km9etl31\">Greimas Six Actants</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/l00lg6ec5vedzutse88bwr8\">@roland-barthes</a> defines general parts of narration, for example functions and indices.\n<ul>\n<li>functions\nare mostly plot related, whereas the indices can refer to characters and their features.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/qgxr81bxdh6l6g2z54labyq\">@manfred-pfister</a> takes different aspects, like the relation between the audience and the characters\nin dramas, into account\n<ul>\n<li>ranks the “dramatis personae”, the\ncharacters, according to general features, like the social status or sex.</li>\n<li>suggests examining characters in opposition to others</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/hppjzlix2l9i9w1x26to41o\">@jurij-lotman</a> classifies characters as active elements, which carry the plot.\n<ul>\n<li>By concentrating on oppositional and plot-oriented aspects of characters, other important things might not be taken into account. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/nkgqkolkamxe9xidg47xm3i\">@fotis-jannidis</a>'s approach is based on theories belonging to linguistic and cognitive science oriented literature studies\n<ul>\n<li>is interested in the process of collecting information from different text sections and arranging them as a unit, which represents a character.</li>\n<li>features or the actions of a character can be a part of more general problems or patterns.
