href=\"#abstract\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital Libraries (DLs), especially in the Cultural Heritage domain, are rich in narratives. Every digital object in a DL tells some kind of story, regardless of the medium, the genre, or the type of the object. However, DLs do not offer services about narratives, for example it is not possible to discover a narrative, to create one, or to compare two narratives. Certainly, DLs offer discovery functionalities over their contents, but these services merely address the objects that carry the narratives (e.g. books, images, audiovisual objects), without regard for the narratives themselves. The present work aims at introducing narratives as first-class citizens in DLs, by providing a formal expression of what a narrative is. In particular, this paper presents a conceptualization of the domain of narratives, and its specification through the Narrative Ontology (NOnt for short), expressed in first-order logic. NOnt has been implemented as an extension of three standard vocabularies, i.e. the CIDOC CRM, FRBRoo, and OWL Time, and using the SWRL rule language to express the axioms. An initial validation of NOnt has been performed in the context of the Mingei European project, in which the ontology has been applied to the representation of knowledge about Craft Heritage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"highlights\">Highlights<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#highlights\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>formal narratives should not replace traditional, informal narrat- ives: rather, they should enhance them, by adding a formal dimension to the existing one.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"russian-formalists\">Russian Formalists<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#russian-formalists\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>According to the Russian formalists, a narrative consists of:\n– the fabula, i.e., the story itself as it happened, in reality or in fiction;\n– the narrations, i.e., one or more expressions, each in its own language and medium, that narrate the fabula. Each narration corresponds to Bal’s definition of presentation [4];\n– the plot, i.e., the story as it is narrated by the narrator.

narrators, the authors of the narration, and of a narration content. \n<ul>\n<li>the narration content is a message, and it may take any form in which a fabula can be communicated, ranging from text,

the sequence of fragments in the order established in the narration by the narrator.</li>\n<li>Because a fabula is identified by its composing events, two narrations of the same fabula may differ for any combination of the following:\n<ol>\n<li>the set of events of the fabula narrated by the narrations; each narration may pick a different subset of events, as a way of giving more  emphasis to

such narrations into narratives, endowing them with a formal representation of the corresponding fabulae, acting as a semantical counterpart of those narrations\n<ul>\n<li>t.2024.08.26.13 narration -> narrative means adding fabula and references</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>this two-level representation of the narrative allows supporting the union of the use cases supported by the purely syntactical (i.e. based solely on narrations) and the purely semantical (i.e. based solely on fabulae) representations</li>\n<li>A narrative may be constructed in at least two\ndifferent ways:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>formalisation</strong>: starting from a narration and associating it to a fabula, or</li>\n<li><strong>documentation</strong>: starting from a fabula and associating it to a narration of the fabula.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It must be noted that either the narration or the fabula of a narrative may provide an incomplete, or even inaccurate, account of the story that the narrative is about.\n<ul>\n<li>t.2024.08.26.13 maybe not surprising, given that fabula means \"representation of the fabula\" at this point</li>\n<li>for this reason, the fabula of a narrative must be treated as a knowledge base, i.e., set of statements giving the best available approx- imation of the fabula according to the narrator of the narrative.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The relationship between the real fabula and its representation may be precisely characterised from a logical point of view as follows:\n<ul>\n<li>A real fabula <em>f</em> may be seen as a set of possible worlds, namely of the worlds that are compatible with the events in the fabula and the relationships that link these events to each other and to their factual components</li>\n<li>Let S<sub>f</sub> be the maximal set of formal fabula statements that are true in every world in f</li>\n<li>Let k be a non-empty KB with the formal representation of <em>f</em></li>\n<li>Then,\n<ul>\n<li>k is an accurate representation of f iff every statement in k is true in the fabula, formally iff k |= S f , where |= is the logical implication relation</li>\n<li>k is a complete representation of f iff k says everything about f, formally iff S f |= k.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the presence of different versions of the same story is not to be seen as accidental or undesirable in a DL\n<ul>\n<li>the arising of
