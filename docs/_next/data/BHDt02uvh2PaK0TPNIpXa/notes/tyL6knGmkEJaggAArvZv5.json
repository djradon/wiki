Other key elements that form knowledge include:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-concepts\">1. <strong>Concepts</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#1-concepts\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Concepts are the <strong>basic units of thought</strong> or understanding. They represent ideas, categories, or mental constructs that allow us to make sense of the world. For instance, concepts like \"tree,\" \"justice,\" or \"speed\" allow us to identify and categorize objects, properties, and processes in the world.</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: The concept of \"gravity\" is a fundamental idea that helps us understand why objects fall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-facts\">2. <strong>Facts</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#2-facts\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Facts are <strong>specific pieces of information</strong> about the world that are believed to be true. They represent particular states of affairs or propositions that describe reality.</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: \"The Earth orbits the Sun\" is a factual piece of knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3-propositions\">3. <strong>Propositions</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#3-propositions\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Propositions are <strong>statements</strong> that express ideas or assertions that can be true or false. They convey factual information but also encode <strong>beliefs</strong> or <strong>claims</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: \"Water freezes at 0°C\" is a proposition that expresses a fact about the physical world.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"4-rulesprinciples\">4. <strong>Rules/Principles</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#4-rulesprinciples\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rules or principles are <strong>guidelines</strong> or <strong>laws</strong> that govern how things behave or interact. They often arise from observations of patterns or regularities in the world and help organize knowledge into systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: Newton's laws of motion describe how physical objects move and interact under forces.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"5-perceptionsobservations\">5. <strong>Perceptions/Observations</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#5-perceptionsobservations\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Perceptions and observations are the <strong>direct experiences</strong> or <strong>sensory data</strong> that we collect from interacting with the world. They are the <strong>raw data</strong> that help us form knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: Observing that the sky is blue is a form of direct knowledge based on perception.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"6-beliefs\">6. <strong>Beliefs</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#6-beliefs\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beliefs</strong> represent <strong>personal or collective understandings</strong> about how the world works, which may or may not be fully verifiable. They form the foundation upon which knowledge claims are built.</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: A belief that the universe has infinite possibilities can drive philosophical inquiries into metaphysics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"7-cognitive-models\">7. <strong>Cognitive Models</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#7-cognitive-models\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cognitive models are <strong>mental frameworks</strong> or <strong>structures</strong> that we use to organize information and predict outcomes. They help us make sense of the world by providing structured ways of interpreting data and experiences.</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: A mental model of how ecosystems work helps scientists understand the interactions between species and their environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"8-inferencesconclusions\">8. <strong>Inferences/Conclusions</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#8-inferencesconclusions\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Inferences and conclusions are the <strong>reasoned outcomes</strong> drawn from data, facts, and rules. They represent <strong>deductions or inductions</strong> that expand on what is known to predict or explain new information.</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: Based on past data, scientists infer that a certain species will thrive in a particular environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"9-experience\">9. <strong>Experience</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#9-experience\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Practical experience</strong> provides knowledge through <strong>doing</strong> or <strong>practice</strong>. It represents applied knowledge in real-world contexts, leading to skills and expertise.</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: A carpenter gains knowledge about wood types and tools through hands-on experience over years of practice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#summary\"></a></h3>\n<p>Knowledge is a multifaceted structure composed of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Concepts</strong>, <strong>facts</strong>, and <strong>propositions</strong> as core building blocks;</li>\n<li><strong>Relations</strong> that connect these components and give them meaning;</li>\n<li><strong>Rules</strong> and <strong>principles</strong> that guide understanding;</li>\n<li><strong>Perceptions</strong>, <strong>beliefs</strong>, <strong>models</strong>, and <strong>inferences</strong> that add depth;</li>\n<li><strong>Experience</strong> that refines and applies this knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These elements interact, with <strong>relations</strong> playing a vital role in linking them together, but knowledge itself is broader than just relational structures.</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><a
