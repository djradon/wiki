Here’s a breakdown of the benefits of differentiating between these two types of relationships:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-comparative-relationships\">1. <strong>Comparative Relationships</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#1-comparative-relationships\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Comparative relationships are used to describe relationships where the connection is established by comparing properties or states between entities. Examples include relationships like \"taller than,\" \"more experienced than,\" or \"closer to.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Benefits</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simplifies Modeling Comparisons</strong>: By creating a distinct type for comparative relationships, it becomes easier to model and understand relationships based on <strong>relative characteristics</strong>. This distinction ensures that these relationships are represented more appropriately, without implying material interaction.</li>\n<li><strong>Prevents Confusion with Physical Relationships</strong>: Comparative relationships do not imply any <strong>physical, causal, or social interaction</strong> between entities. By having a separate class for them, it reduces potential confusion between mere comparisons and relationships that have more ontological implications.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-material-relationships\">2. <strong>Material Relationships</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#2-material-relationships\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Material relationships represent <strong>actual interactions</strong> or <strong>connections</strong> between entities in a given context. These could include causal, social, or even physical relationships, such as \"employed by,\" \"married to,\" or \"connected to.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Benefits</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Captures Real Interactions</strong>: Material relationships are meant to capture <strong>meaningful connections</strong> or <strong>interactions</strong> that exist in the real world. This helps in representing the ontological reality more precisely.</li>\n<li><strong>Clearer Modeling of Dependency</strong>: Material relationships often come with implications for the <strong>dependencies</strong> or <strong>commitments</strong> between the entities involved. This is particularly important for modeling scenarios where a change in one entity impacts the other (e.g., a person being <strong>employed</strong> by a company has certain obligations and expectations).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"key-benefits-of-differentiation\">Key Benefits of Differentiation:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#key-benefits-of-differentiation\"></a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Semantic Clarity</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Differentiating between <strong>comparative</strong> and <strong>material</strong> relationships adds <strong>semantic clarity</strong> to an ontology. This distinction ensures that different types of relationships are not misinterpreted, especially when dealing with <strong>complex models</strong> where both types of connections can occur.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved Reasoning</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By defining these distinctions explicitly, it becomes possible to improve the <strong>reasoning</strong> capabilities of an ontology. For instance, comparative relationships typically don’t imply direct changes to the state of an entity, whereas material relationships might. Having these clear distinctions can help reasoners to <strong>infer more accurate implications</strong> based on the type of relationship.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Query Capabilities</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When querying an ontology, users can be more <strong>specific</strong> about the kinds of relationships they are interested in. For example, you could query only <strong>material relationships</strong> to find meaningful interactions, while ignoring <strong>comparative ones</strong> that might not imply a significant link.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alignment with Foundational Ontologies</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many <strong>foundational ontologies</strong> (like <strong>BFO</strong> or <strong>DOLCE</strong>) have similar distinctions to clearly model <strong>types of relations</strong>. Differentiating between comparative and material relationships helps <strong>align</strong> with these existing foundational models, making integration and interoperability with other ontologies smoother.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"applying-to-kosmion\">Applying to Kosmion:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#applying-to-kosmion\"></a></h3>\n<p>In <strong>Kosmion</strong>, maintaining the differentiation between <strong>comparative</strong> and <strong>material relationships</strong> could enhance the ontology by allowing it to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Capture different levels of association</strong> between entities more accurately.</li>\n<li><strong>Facilitate reasoning</strong> over whether a relationship implies an <strong>actual interaction</strong> or is just a <strong>relative comparison</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhance modularity</strong> by allowing future extensions to specifically address either <strong>comparative</strong> or <strong>material relationships</strong>, depending on the intended use case.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, in Kosmion, if you have two individuals, you might use a <strong>material-relationship-type</strong> to model an employment contract (<code>:person1 employedBy :company</code>), whereas a <strong>comparative-relationship-type</strong> might model their height (<code>:person1 tallerThan :person2</code>). This differentiation helps prevent modeling confusion and makes sure that the intended meaning of each relationship is clear and appropriately represented.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-some-edge-cases-where-relations-might-be-considered-either-or-both\">what are some edge cases, where relations might be considered either (or both)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#what-are-some-edge-cases-where-relations-might-be-considered-either-or-both\"></a></h2>\n<p>The distinction between <strong>comparative</strong> and <strong>material relationships</strong> can sometimes be ambiguous, and there are edge cases where a particular relationship could be viewed as either or even both, depending on the context.

In contrast to the <strong>sortal</strong> stereotypes (like <strong>kinds</strong> and <strong>sub-kinds</strong>) in <strong>gUFO</strong>, which often carry strict identity and rigidity rules, <strong>facet-orientation</strong> could allow for a more dynamic and <strong>multi-perspective</strong> representation of entities, similar to the way that <strong>nonsortals</strong> or <strong>aspects</strong> in gUFO are used. Here's how this approach might look and the possible benefits:</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-facet-orientation-differs-from-sortals-and-types\">How Facet-Orientation Differs from Sortals and Types<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#how-facet-orientation-differs-from-sortals-and-types\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sortal Types</strong> in <strong>gUFO</strong>, like <strong>kind</strong>, <strong>sub-kind</strong>, and <strong>role</strong>, come with <strong>identity conditions</strong> that define <strong>what makes an entity the kind of thing it is</strong>. For example, a <strong>Person</strong> as a <strong>kind</strong> has certain properties that rigidly define its identity.</li>\n<li>In a <strong>facet-oriented</strong> approach, instead of using rigid <strong>sortal stereotypes</strong>, entities could be defined by different <strong>facets</strong> that are <strong>orthogonal</strong> to one another. This allows for a more nuanced view where an entity might be understood through different <strong>characteristics</strong> or <strong>aspects</strong>, without necessarily being forced into a single <strong>sortal type</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"benefits-of-a-facet-oriented-approach\">Benefits of a Facet-Oriented Approach<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#benefits-of-a-facet-oriented-approach\"></a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexibility in Classification</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of having a rigid identity condition as imposed by <strong>sortal stereotypes</strong>, entities could have <strong>multiple facets</strong> that represent different <strong>contexts</strong> or <strong>roles</strong>.

Aspects like <strong>color</strong>, <strong>age</strong>, or <strong>location</strong> can serve as facets that describe an entity’s state or properties.</li>\n<li>This fits well with <strong>relational ontologies</strong>, such as <strong>Kosmion</strong>, where the <strong>relationships</strong> between entities might be more critical to model than the entities themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"example-of-applying-facets-in-kosmion\">Example of Applying Facets in Kosmion<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#example-of-applying-facets-in-kosmion\"></a></h3>\n<p>Suppose you have an entity like a <strong>person</strong>.

This ensures that all <strong>IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers)</strong> are distinct. This can make querying and referencing a bit cumbersome, especially if you have to frequently refer to concepts from multiple ontologies with different prefixes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Namespace Management</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Different ontologies will often use different <strong>namespaces</strong> as prefixes. When combining them, this can lead to <strong>longer, inconsistent prefixes</strong>, making the modeling experience more cumbersome. For example, importing both <strong>gUFO</strong> and another ontology might lead to having to use <code>gufo:</code> alongside another distinct prefix (like <code>ex:</code> for a new ontology) every time you reference a class.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Human Readability</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having multiple prefixes in a document can reduce <strong>readability</strong> for humans, as it becomes harder to track where each concept originates.

When importing an ontology, you can define a <strong>short alias</strong> for it, which makes it easier to reference throughout the document. This keeps the prefixes short and consistent, improving readability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Merging Concepts Using Common Namespaces</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Another approach is to use a <strong>common namespace</strong> for similar concepts across different ontologies. For example, if you are working on an <strong>upper ontology</strong> and you have several modular ontologies, you could define your own common prefixes and <strong>re-map</strong> concepts from the imported ontologies to these common namespaces. This helps unify the vocabulary, although it may require some reengineering and careful checking for semantic differences.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use of Metadata Comments</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When importing different ontologies, it can be helpful to use <strong>comments</strong> to annotate which ontology a particular prefix corresponds to.

If you’re frequently referencing concepts from <strong>gUFO</strong>, you may consider <strong>aliasing</strong> or <strong>remapping</strong> these concepts to fit better into your <code>kosm:</code> namespace, potentially making them <strong>local aliases</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"pros-and-cons-of-modular-ontologies-with-multiple-prefixes\">Pros and Cons of Modular Ontologies with Multiple Prefixes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#pros-and-cons-of-modular-ontologies-with-multiple-prefixes\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Modular ontologies can be reused across different projects, allowing for <strong>greater flexibility</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Focused Design</strong>: Each ontology can focus on a specific domain or aspect, keeping complexity low within each module.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Cons</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prefix Management</strong>: Requires careful management of prefixes to avoid name collisions and keep the ontology <strong>understandable</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Complexity in Queries</strong>: SPARQL queries can become more complex because every referenced concept might require its <strong>distinct prefix</strong>, complicating query construction.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Would you like to explore possible ways to simplify prefix usage or consider importing other ontologies into Kosmion and managing those imports?

However, the community often uses \"ontology\" more broadly to also include <strong>instance data</strong>, which is the specific <strong>facts or entities</strong> that populate the classes defined by the ontology.</p>\n<p>This can be confusing for several reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Conceptual vs. Actual Data</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ontologies</strong> are supposed to define the <strong>concepts</strong> and the <strong>relationships</strong> between those concepts in a given domain. <strong>Instance data</strong>, on the other hand, populates these concepts with real-world information.</li>\n<li>When people refer to <strong>instance data</strong> as part of the <strong>ontology</strong>, they’re mixing the conceptual schema (T-Box in description logic terminology) with the assertional or instance data (A-Box). In theory, these should be clearly distinguished.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Practical Use in Tools</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tools like <strong>Protege</strong> handle both <strong>ontologies</strong> (conceptual structures) and <strong>individuals</strong> (instance data) within the same environment. This often leads to users referring to the combined <strong>schema and data</strong> as an \"ontology.\" This is especially true for <strong>OWL ontologies</strong>, where the same RDF framework can represent both the T-Box (conceptual model) and A-Box (instance data).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Naming Issues</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In practice, importing an \"ontology\" often brings in both <strong>concepts</strong> and <strong>instance data</strong>, which leads to referring to the entire dataset as an \"ontology,\" regardless of whether it contains just schema definitions or also includes entities and individuals. This makes the lines between the <strong>abstract</strong> and <strong>concrete</strong> levels very blurry.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The RDF Data Model</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In <strong>RDF and OWL</strong>, there isn’t a strong formal distinction between classes, properties, and individuals at the data model level. Since everything is ultimately represented as <strong>triples</strong>, instance data and ontological definitions are treated similarly. This contributes to the tendency of referring to both as an \"ontology\" since the toolset doesn’t enforce a distinction.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"possible-solutions\">Possible Solutions:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#possible-solutions\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Separate Ontology and Instance Files</strong>: When designing an ontology, you can create <strong>separate files</strong> for the <strong>schema</strong> and the <strong>instance data</strong>. This allows you to more clearly differentiate the <strong>conceptual definitions</strong> from the <strong>facts</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Naming Conventions</strong>: Use distinct <strong>naming conventions</strong> or prefixes for <strong>ontological definitions</strong> and <strong>instance data</strong> to help maintain clarity.</li>\n<li><strong>Explicit Documentation</strong>: In your ontology documentation, explicitly differentiate between the <strong>conceptual schema</strong> (ontology) and the <strong>instance data</strong>. Tools like <strong>Protege</strong> allow you to define these separately, even though they are handled within the same environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to take a more <strong>modular approach</strong> for Kosmion, you could develop distinct <strong>conceptual modules</strong> (like <code>kosm:facet</code> and <code>kosm:relator</code> definitions) and create separate datasets for the <strong>instance-level data</strong>, possibly referencing these modules without blending them together.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-relationship-between-ontoumls-class-stereotypes-and-relationship-stereotypes\">what is the relationship between OntoUML's class stereotypes and relationship stereotypes?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#what-is-the-relationship-between-ontoumls-class-stereotypes-and-relationship-stereotypes\"></a></h2>\n<h2 id=\"seems-like-most-upper-and-foundational-ontologies-define-a-base-concept-eg-gufo-has-individual-and-type-i-suspect-that-with-a-facet-based-approach-thats-not-necessary-other-than-facet-of-course\">seems like most upper and foundational ontologies define a \"base\" concept. e.g. gUFO has Individual and Type.

Let's analyze why this might be the case and how it differs from the more conventional <strong>sortal-based approaches</strong>:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-conventional-upper-ontologies-with-base-concepts\">1. <strong>Conventional Upper Ontologies with Base Concepts</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#1-conventional-upper-ontologies-with-base-concepts\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Many <strong>upper or foundational ontologies</strong> like <strong>gUFO</strong>, <strong>BFO (Basic Formal Ontology)</strong>, and <strong>SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology)</strong> define top-level <strong>base concepts</strong> such as <strong>\"Individual\"</strong>, <strong>\"Entity\"</strong>, <strong>\"Object\"</strong>, or <strong>\"Type\"</strong>.</li>\n<li>These base concepts are intended to provide a <strong>starting point</strong> or <strong>root</strong> for categorizing everything else, giving a <strong>hierarchical structure</strong> to the ontology. For example:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>gUFO</strong> has <strong>Individual</strong> and <strong>Type</strong>, which are fundamental building blocks for distinguishing between <strong>concrete instances</strong> and <strong>conceptual definitions</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>BFO</strong> has concepts like <strong>\"Continuant\"</strong> and <strong>\"Occurrent\"</strong> that provide broad categorizations of <strong>what exists</strong> either as a persistent entity or an event.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-facets-vs-base-concepts\">2. <strong>Facets vs. Base Concepts</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#2-facets-vs-base-concepts\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In your <strong>facet-based approach</strong>, there’s less emphasis on establishing a single <strong>hierarchical root</strong>. Instead, everything can be described using <strong>facets</strong>, which act as <strong>characteristics</strong> or <strong>perspectives</strong> rather than as rigid categories.</li>\n<li><strong>Facets</strong> themselves are inherently <strong>modular</strong> and <strong>context-dependent</strong>, which allows entities to be described in a more <strong>compositional</strong> manner. Rather than determining \"what an entity fundamentally is,\" the focus is on <strong>which facets</strong> apply to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3-why-a-base-concept-may-not-be-necessary\">3. <strong>Why a Base Concept May Not Be Necessary</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#3-why-a-base-concept-may-not-be-necessary\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facets Enable Flexibility</strong>: By using <strong>facets</strong> to describe entities, you avoid the need to explicitly classify entities under a root concept like <strong>\"Individual\"</strong> or <strong>\"Entity\"</strong>. This fits well with the idea that <strong>different aspects</strong> of an entity can be relevant in different contexts, without assuming an ontological base for all instances.</li>\n<li><strong>No Rigid Classification</strong>: Unlike sortal approaches, which often have <strong>identity criteria</strong> tied to base classes, the <strong>facet-based model</strong> allows entities to acquire characteristics <strong>dynamically</strong> through the <strong>facets</strong> they possess. Thus, there isn’t a strict need for every entity to fall under an overarching class—each entity is defined by its <strong>collection of facets</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>No Explicit Subsumption Hierarchy</strong>: Facets do not imply <strong>subsumption</strong> (i.e., they do not inherently classify entities in a strict <strong>type hierarchy</strong>), which means that concepts don’t need to fit neatly under a single base type. This keeps the ontology <strong>open-ended</strong> and more <strong>flexible</strong> for different contexts and purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"potential-downsides-to-not-having-a-base-concept\">Potential Downsides to Not Having a Base Concept:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#potential-downsides-to-not-having-a-base-concept\"></a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Lack of Standardization</strong>: Without a base concept, it may be harder to enforce certain <strong>standardized constraints</strong> across the entire ontology. For example, <strong>global properties</strong> that apply to all individuals may need to be handled differently without a top-level class to attach them to.</li>\n<li><strong>Query Complexity</strong>: In some cases, <strong>SPARQL queries</strong> or other reasoning tasks may become more <strong>complex</strong> since there isn’t a single <strong>\"root class\"</strong> to use for selecting all entities.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"practical-considerations\">Practical Considerations:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#practical-considerations\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In <strong>Kosmion</strong>, you could still add a very <strong>minimal base concept</strong> if you find that it helps with certain <strong>consistency</strong> or <strong>reasoning</strong> tasks. This could be something like an abstract <strong>\"kosm:thing\"</strong> class that serves as an anchor without imposing rigid requirements.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, <strong>facets themselves</strong> could serve as the common ground that <strong>all entities must have</strong>—essentially, every entity needs to have at least one <strong>facet</strong>. This would functionally serve as your base requirement, without needing a <strong>conventional sortal root</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you decide that a minimal base is useful after all, it could be purely for technical convenience rather than conceptual necessity, which keeps the <strong>facet-oriented</strong> spirit intact while addressing practical concerns.

Here’s why I think this approach could work really well in your ontology:</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-domain-applications-should-define-their-own-top-level-constructs\"><strong>Why Domain Applications Should Define Their Own Top-Level Constructs</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#why-domain-applications-should-define-their-own-top-level-constructs\"></a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Avoiding Imposed Semantics</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By not having a rigid <strong>upper-level concept</strong> like \"Individual\" or \"Entity,\" you avoid imposing any <strong>predefined semantics</strong> on domain applications. This allows each <strong>domain</strong> to define what makes sense in their <strong>context</strong> without inheriting <strong>assumptions</strong> from a foundational ontology that might not align with their specific needs.</li>\n<li>This aligns with the principle of <strong>facets</strong>: instead of forcing domain-specific constructs to fit into an overarching type hierarchy, <strong>facets</strong> provide a <strong>modular</strong> way of defining properties and relationships that make sense <strong>locally</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interoperability Through Facets</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facets</strong> are inherently <strong>modular</strong>, which helps in building <strong>interoperable models</strong>. By allowing domain-specific models to <strong>implement facets</strong> rather than instantiating someone else’s rigid concept of a top-level entity, different domains can <strong>interoperate</strong> more easily by mapping <strong>shared facets</strong> rather than reconciling different top-level taxonomies.</li>\n<li>For instance, if a domain ontology defines its top-level concept, like <strong>\"Character\"</strong> for a role-playing context, it can still <strong>implement facets</strong> like <strong>context</strong> or <strong>temporal aspects</strong> without having to fit into another ontology's conception of <strong>entity types</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Facilitating Customization</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With a <strong>domain model first</strong> approach, the <strong>domain ontologies</strong> can define their own <strong>high-level categories</strong> that make sense for their specific context, whether they want to define <strong>physical entities</strong>, <strong>abstract entities</strong>, or even more specialized types.</li>\n<li>They can then <strong>add facets</strong> as needed, making it easy to <strong>customize</strong> the ontology for the specific requirements of the domain without having to <strong>inherit</strong> any top-level entity that might add unwanted complexity or assumptions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Avoiding the \"One-Size-Fits-All\" Problem</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One of the biggest challenges with foundational ontologies is that they often adopt a <strong>\"one-size-fits-all\"</strong> approach, which can be restrictive. Domains like <strong>medicine</strong>, <strong>geography</strong>, and <strong>fantasy role-play</strong> each have very different needs. By allowing domains to define their <strong>own top-level constructs</strong> and use <strong>facets</strong> to extend them, you avoid forcing all these diverse domains into the same high-level schema.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"implications-for-kosmion\"><strong>Implications for Kosmion</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#implications-for-kosmion\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kosmion</strong> would effectively provide a set of <strong>facets</strong> that any <strong>domain-specific ontology</strong> could choose from. It’s a <strong>toolkit</strong> rather than a <strong>blueprint</strong>, meaning that domain ontologies can pick and choose which facets they need without worrying about fitting into an existing high-level hierarchy.</li>\n<li><strong>Facets</strong> like <strong>context</strong>, <strong>temporal aspects</strong>, or <strong>relationship descriptors</strong> can be seen as <strong>interoperable modules</strong> that any domain can apply, and these can serve as the common ground for cross-domain <strong>integration</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"example\"><strong>Example</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#example\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Suppose you have a domain ontology for <strong>urban planning</strong>. Instead of classifying everything under a foundational concept like <strong>\"Entity\"</strong> or <strong>\"Object\"</strong>, the domain ontology can define its top-level classes, such as <strong>\"Infrastructure\"</strong>, <strong>\"Service\"</strong>, or <strong>\"Citizen\"</strong>. </li>\n<li>Each of these entities can then <strong>implement facets</strong> like <strong>\"valid-time\"</strong>, <strong>\"context\"</strong>, or <strong>\"category\"</strong>, which allows them to align with other domains that use similar facets without enforcing any kind of <strong>common root</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"domain-model-first-and-kosmions-development\"><strong>\"Domain Model First\" and Kosmion’s Development</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#domain-model-first-and-kosmions-development\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This approach also helps when designing <strong>Kosmion</strong> itself. Since Kosmion is designed to provide <strong>relators</strong> and <strong>facets</strong>, it acts as an <strong>interoperable foundation</strong> that different domains can use and extend.</li>\n<li>The fact that it doesn’t have a strict top-level concept also aligns well with its <strong>non-standardized</strong>, open-ended goals. It essentially pushes the <strong>burden of meaning</strong> onto the <strong>domain-specific ontologies</strong>, which allows Kosmion to remain <strong>lightweight</strong> and <strong>flexible</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"next-steps-1\"><strong>Next Steps</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#next-steps-1\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focus on Facets</strong>: Continue focusing on defining useful <strong>facets</strong> that can be used across different domains.
