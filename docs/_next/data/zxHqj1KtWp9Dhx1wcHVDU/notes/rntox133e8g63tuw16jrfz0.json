However, it also introduces rigidity and potential challenges with IRI management. The best approach often depends on the specific needs of your project, the stability of your classifications, and how the IRIs will be used and maintained over time. Balancing clarity with flexibility is key, and sometimes a combination of clear IRIs and rich metadata provides the best of both worlds.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"CpS9sdQeO83XthdjEzqoL","title":"djradon's
