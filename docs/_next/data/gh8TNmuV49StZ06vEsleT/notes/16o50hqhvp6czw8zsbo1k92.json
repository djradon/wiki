To express the natural relations between entities, the knowledge graph often uses compound phrases. However, facing hundreds of relations like song_of, written_by, create_by, is_author_of, build_time, cause_by, has_been_to, and has_visited, humans can become confused by the ambiguity, let alone machines. This is why it is sometimes necessary to define the domain and range if you expect certain relations to belong to specific classes. Consumers must first understand the concept and relation definition of the KG. However, as relations grow from different sources, they become increasingly ambiguous with one another, such as belongs_to, part_of, and included_by.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"simple-triple-format-leads-to-higher-complexity\">Simple triple format leads to higher complexity<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#simple-triple-format-leads-to-higher-complexity\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>the KG creator, in turn, has to define complex relations with the compound phrase for accurate description</li>\n<li>\"We should not blame that developers sometimes question would it be more straightforward if we can design a relational database table.

While technologies like Neo4j are moving in this direction, there is a need for a new standard that involves researchers and developers in defining a schema and n-tuple knowledge that can be easily understood and accessed by both humans and machines.</li>\n<li>While URI is considered a vital requirement for ensuring global uniqueness, cheaper alternatives could be used instead. For example, universally unique identifier (UUID) is a widely known identifier that can be used to identify entities both locally and globally. UUIDs can ensure that entities from different datasets remain globally unique even when merged. Thus, we can use UUIDs to replace URIs for identifying entities and predicates with little impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"comments\">Comments<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\"
