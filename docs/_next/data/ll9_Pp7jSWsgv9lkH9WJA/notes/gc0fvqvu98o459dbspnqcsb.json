Neither are musts but there's 2 mint options in this project: </p>\n<pre><code>L1 will allow you to mint the L1 Trophy.\nMatic will allow you to mint your own VRM Avatar. So you can test out the whole flow of then having an avatar tied to your persona.\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a note, if ever you have another NFT Avatar you would love to use, we can help you get that setup, if it isn't already registered in our Emergence Avatar System.\nAlchemist 19\n—\nToday at 9:44 AM\nYou guys totally rock!!!\nSifr\n—\nToday at 9:44 AM\nJust realised I signed up to Lamina1 through email, so my address is actually 0x676E706aE6a7475bB2629E1011e942e619040fb1\nWillCarter\n—\nToday at 9:45 AM\nYou're bleeding me dry\nAleissia\n—\nToday at 9:45 AM\nGameplay Examples of some things you can do with Emergence.

I presume that we could retool the avatar system so that it works on the Lamina1 blockchain (provided that we either provide, or there is present, a comparable contract on Lamina1)?  I know this would not make it work across the whole Emergence ecosystem, but I'm just thinking of ways to keep things simple for Lamina1 users (to keep everything within the Lamina1 network, and users needing only the one token).\nAleissia\n—\nToday at 9:46 AM\nRight after were done here, <a title=\"Private\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"private\">@Chris (Private)</a> could hop on with you!

We want to dive into loads of these examples! This first 101 was meant to be able to show the basics of getting setup. And the basics of how to use the read / write functionality. From there though, future workshops will show how to use the read / write for loads of gameplay examples!\nAlchemist 19\n—\nToday at 9:51 AM\n<a title=\"Private\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"private\">@Aleissia (Private)</a> awesome work thus far\nAleissia\n—\nToday at 9:54 AM\nWe have a BOUNTY for todays workshop!

Which can be great for non-coders.\nChris\n—\nToday at 9:59 AM\nwould you be able to post the log file?\nEL | MALAMAYA\n—\nToday at 9:59 AM\nWhat do I say? I'm keen on making assets for games and metaverse platforms 🍻\nChris\n—\nToday at 10:00 AM\nthere might be a build log file in saved/logs\nivystive\n—\nToday at 10:00 AM\nYes.

It raises questions about who is allowed to extend functionality and how to use that functionality which we're working on\nAleissia\n—\nToday at 10:06 AM\nGreat question! </p>\n<p>As of right now, this is a way to add additional metadata to NFT collections. That is currently saved off-chain with using all the authentication / etc of what the owner of the NFT sets for it. </p>\n<p>We are also building out standard templates so NEW nft creators can utilize that as well. </p>\n<p>Goal is to be allow any creator / developer to treat an NFT like a game object. Read/Write based on the permissions the owner sets.\nFuture workshop JUST on Dynamic Metadata would be fun!\nWillCarter\n—\nToday at 10:07 AM\nOh yeah Dynamic Metadata workshop would be cool\nBeforeCrypto\n—\nToday at 10:08 AM\n⁠Unreal 5.3.1\nMAiWORLD\n—\nToday at 10:08 AM\nsuper cool, thank you, and yes need that dynamic metadata workshop
