What is a frame? Consider the following set of words: reservation, flight, travel, buy, price, cost, fare, rates, meal, plane There are many individual lexical relations of hyponymy, synonymy, and so on between many of the words in this list. The resulting set of relations does not, however, add up to a complete account of how these words are related. They are clearly all defined with respect to a coherent chunk of common-sense background information concerning air travel. We call the holistic background knowledge that unites these words a frame </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of the semantic roles (frame elements) in the frame are.... separated into core roles, which are frame specific and non-core roles, which are more like the Arg-M arguments in PropBank, expressing  general properties of time, location, and so on</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Core Roles\nATTRIBUTE The ATTRIBUTE is a scalar property that the ITEM possesses.\nDIFFERENCE The distance by which an ITEM changes its position on the scale.\nFINAL STATE A description that presents the ITEM’s state after the change in the ATTRIBUTE’s value as an independent predication.\nFINAL VALUE The position on the scale where the ITEM ends up.\nINITIAL STATE A description that presents the ITEM’s state before the change in the ATTRIBUTE’s value as an independent predication.\nINITIAL VALUE The initial position on the scale from which the ITEM moves away.\nITEM The entity that has a position on the scale.\nVALUE RANGE A portion of the scale, typically identified by its end points, along which the values of the ATTRIBUTE fluctuate.</p>\n<p>Some Non-Core Roles\nDURATION The length of time over which the change takes place.\nSPEED The rate of change of the VALUE.\nGROUP The GROUP in which an ITEM changes the value of an\nATTRIBUTE in a specified way</p>\n<h4 id=\"selectional-restrictions\">Selectional Restrictions<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#selectional-restrictions\"></a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>SRs are a semantic type constraint that a verb imposes on the kind of concepts that are allowed to fill its argument\nroles.</li>\n<li>In the earliest implementations, selectional restrictions were considered strict con- straints on the kind of arguments a predicate could take\n<ul>\n<li>it became clear that these selectional restrictions were better represented as preferences rather than strict constraints\n<ul>\n<li>selectional restriction violations (like inedible arguments of eat) often occur in well-formed sentences, for example because they are negated (20.36), or because selectional restrictions are overstated</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>selection preference strength defines the amount of information that a predicate tells us about the semantic class of its argu-\nments. </li>\n<li>Most semantic role labeling schemes only work within a single sentence, fo- cusing on the object of the verbal (or nominal, in the case of NomBank) predicate. However, in many cases, a verbal or nominal predicate may have an implicit argu- ment: one that appears only in a contextual sentence, or perhaps not at all and must be inferred. In the two sentences This house has a new owner. The sale was finalized 10 days ago. the sale in the second sentence has no ARG1, but a reasonable reader would infer that the Arg1 should be the house mentioned in the prior sentence. Find- ing these arguments, implicit argument detection (sometimes shortened as iSRL)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"primitive-decomposition-of-predicates\">Primitive Decomposition of Predicates<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#primitive-decomposition-of-predicates\"></a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The decompositional approach asserts that a single state-like predicate associ- ated with open underlies all of these examples. The differences among the meanings of these examples arises from the combination of this single predicate with the prim- itives CAUSE and BECOME. While this approach to primitive decomposition can explain the similarity be- tween states and actions or causative and non-causative predicates, it still relies on having a large number of predicates like open. More radical approaches choose to break down these predicates as well. One such approach to verbal predicate de- composition that played a role in early natural language understanding systems is conceptual dependency (CD), a set of ten primitive predicates:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Primitive Definition\nATRANS The abstract transfer of possession or control from one entity to\nanother\nPTRANS The physical transfer of an object from one location to another\nMTRANS The transfer of mental concepts between entities or within an\nentity\nMBUILD The creation of new information within an entity\nPROPEL The application of physical force to move an object\nMOVE The integral movement of a body part by an animal\nINGEST The taking in of a substance by an animal\nEXPEL The expulsion of something from an animal\nSPEAK The action of producing a sound\nATTEND The action of focusing a sense organ</p>\n<p>The verb brought is translated into the two primitives ATRANS and PTRANS to indicate that the waiter both physically conveyed the check to Mary and passed control of it to her.</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/5wmc8dgfqxy26r82173lilz\">Thematic Roles
