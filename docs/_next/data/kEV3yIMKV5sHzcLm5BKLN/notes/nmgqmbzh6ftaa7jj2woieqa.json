domain”; domain ontolo- gies “describe [...] the vocabulary related to a generic domain (like medicine, or automo- biles)”; task ontologies “a generic task or activity (like diagnosing or selling)”; finally application ontologies “describe concepts depending both on a particular domain and task, which are often specializations of both the related ontologies. These concepts often correspond to roles played by domain entities while performing a certain activity, like replaceable unit or spare component.\n<ul>\n<li>today domain ontologies and application ontologies are largely used as synonyms, task ontologies are rarely addressed and the most recognized (and perhaps useful) separation is between top-level ontologies and application ontologies</li>\n<li>the practitioner often finds it hard to distinguish the classification of entities by type and by role.</li>\n<li>the ontology is naturally influenced by the observer’s perspective and this freezes the entities into their contextual roles.

Here things are less clear. Generally speaking, where something cannot be modeled directly because of an ontological distinction (e.g. the sharp distinction between material and information objects blocks the simple representation of common-sense objects like a book), these ontologies propose reformulation patterns that are often successful (e.g. the distinction of the book as the material entity and the book as the information entity among which a representation relation holds). Yet, this method cannot always work due to the idiosyncrasy of some application domains and the complexity of some concepts used in applications. To state it briefly, all these ontologies explicitly state their core principles but then allow the user to add arbitrary categories even though these are not ontologically justified or justifiable. While this is built-in in ontologies like DOLCE and GUM, unprincipled ex- tensions should be alien to formal ontologies that adhere to some philosophical school. For the latter systems, the actual exploitations of the ontology in application domains are philosophically wrong but practically accepted, and since an applied ontology has its raison d’être in its use, they make a virtue out of necessity.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/0b2imm674nuakrsadp4m2nb\">Dol Distributed Ontology Model and Specification Language</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3
