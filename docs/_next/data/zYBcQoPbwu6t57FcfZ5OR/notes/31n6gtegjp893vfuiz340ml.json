aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#abstract\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reification is a standard technique in conceptual modeling, which consists of including in the domain of discourse entities that may otherwise be hidden or implicit. However, deciding what should be reified is not always easy. Recent work on formal ontology offers us a simple answer: put in the domain of discourse those entities that are responsible for the (alleged) truth of our propositions. These are called truthmakers. Re-visiting previous work, we propose in this paper a systematic analysis of truthmaking patterns for properties and relations based on the ontological nature of their truthmakers. Truthmaking patterns will be presented as generalization of reification patterns, accounting for the fact that, in some cases, we do not reify a property or a relationship directly, but we rather reify its truthmakers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"highlights\">Highlights<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#highlights\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>strong view: events</li>\n<li>weak view: qualities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"search-for-tms\">Search for TMs<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#search-for-tms\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>our cognitive domain is much bigger than our domain of discourse\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., when we say that John and Mary are married, our language only refers to them, although we know that there has been a wedding event and that there is an ongoing marriage relationship.
