But each top-level folder within an SFDataRepo names a namespace within the site.

Its primary focus is to handle datasets, catalogs, and IRIs effectively, making it ideal for building <strong>semantic web</strong> content from distributed repositories of RDF data. Here's what Metalsmith-SFLO offers:</p>\n<h3 id=\"key-features\">Key Features:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#key-features\"></a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible Namespace and Dataset Management</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supports multiple <strong>namespaces per repository</strong>, and also allows <strong>multiple repositories</strong> to contribute to a single namespace.</li>\n<li>Namespace folders correspond to a <strong>namespace hierarchy</strong>, providing the structure for the data.</li>\n<li>Contributing repositories (<code>sfDataRepos</code>) can expand existing namespaces without directly modifying the original data. This allows the inclusion of <strong>read-only data from external sources</strong>, with contributors being able to add their own data on top of it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>IRI Minting and Collision Management</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When generating a new site from existing data, the generator can automatically handle <strong>IRI redirection and aliasing</strong> through <code>owl:sameAs</code>. SFDataRepos should be designed with IRI references relative to the base, and during initial site generation, users can specify whether they want pre-existing files with different bases to be re-based onto the current site. This effectively mirrors external RDF data to the new site. New datasets will pick up from the next version, and catalog series will be re-based into the new site base. In cases where multiple SFDataRepos have overlapping namespaces and individuals with overlapping dataset series, Metalsmith-SFLO will prompt the user or make a decision to determine which dataset series is current and update the individual's <code>sflo:has_default_catalog_series</code> properties accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Dataset Drafting and Versioning</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metalsmith-SFLO is dataset-series-oriented, meaning that dataset series provide versioning and metadata for individuals. Any individual that is not already a <code>sflo:DatasetSeries</code> will have <code>_default</code> and <code>_catalog</code> series automatically created for them. Metalsmith-SFLO supports both <strong>current</strong> and <strong>draft</strong> states for datasets. The <strong>current dataset</strong> acts as the main working version, while users can start individual drafts, but only updates to <code>current</code> are eventually minted as new versions. Users can manage <strong>draft versions</strong> using a consistent IRI alias (<code>/current</code>) that represents the most recent dataset. Draft IRIs may have more specific identifiers (e.g., <code>/draft-2024-10-30-username</code>) to keep things organized and distinguishable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Site-Level Integration</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metadata and versioning information can be generated for <strong>individual entities</strong>, for an <strong>entire namespace</strong>, or across <strong>all namespaces</strong>.</li>\n<li>During the build process, <code>sfDataRepos</code> are synchronized and scanned for changes. The system then triggers catalog and dataset updates where necessary, minting new versions only upon official release (not for every edit).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Publication and Flexibility</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can configure whether the content of their <code>sfDataRepos</code> is published, and even <strong>obscure sensitive names</strong> through aliasing.</li>\n<li><strong>Selective inclusion</strong>: Some <code>sfDataRepos</code> may not be published, but they can still contribute data to catalogs and extend namespaces indirectly. The static site generator handles this dynamically by managing visibility and integration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User Responsibility and Automation</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The system provides tools to manage <strong>IRI collisions</strong>, but the responsibility ultimately lies with contributors to avoid duplicating existing IRIs. Metalsmith-SFLO includes automatic collision checks and prompts during site generation, ensuring contributors are alerted to any conflicts.</li>\n<li>Automated processes ensure that whenever a new version is generated, catalogs and namespace information are properly updated. Contributors can also rely on the generator to suggest new base IRIs when reusing existing datasets.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"workflow-summary\">Workflow Summary:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#workflow-summary\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial Setup</strong>: Users select existing <code>sfDataRepos</code> or namespaces to create a new site.</li>\n<li><strong>IRI Minting and Equivalency</strong>: The generator handles new base IRIs and inserts <code>owl:sameAs</code> statements to preserve links to original data.</li>\n<li><strong>Drafting and Collaboration</strong>: All changes occur in the <strong>current draft</strong> until ready for a new version, minimizing unnecessary versions while allowing individual experimentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Build and Versioning</strong>: The build process includes automatic scanning of changes, merging updates, and updating catalogs, with the system controlling when new versions are minted to maintain consistency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Metalsmith-SFLO</strong> is designed to make RDF-based static site generation intuitive, flexible, and scalable, providing powerful tools for namespace management, data integration, and version control. Whether you are building from scratch or extending existing data, Metalsmith-SFLO adapts to the complexity of your semantic data needs, while keeping the workflow streamlined and clear.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This version reflects the latest concepts, including re-basing, dataset-series orientation, and updated responsibilities for managing IRIs. Let me know if you need more tweaks!</p>\n<h2 id=\"named-graphs-dave\">named graphs (dave)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#named-graphs-dave\"></a></h2>\n<p>At this point, I don't see a role for named graphs, other than perhaps \"excerpting\" data from other datasets. Am I forgetting something? </p>\n<h2 id=\"named-graphs-chatgpt\">named graphs (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#named-graphs-chatgpt\"></a></h2>\n<p>Named graphs in Semantic Flow primarily serve as a useful way to isolate specific parts of data, like \"excerpting\" from other datasets for reuse or reference. Beyond that, if there are no other complex relationships requiring multiple contexts within a single graph, named graphs may indeed be overkill. This simplifies the data model and focuses more directly on dataset-level operations.</p>\n<p>If there's anything else named graphs were intended for, it seems like it's not currently needed for the core functionality you're aiming for.</p>\n<h2 id=\"namespace-catalog-contents-dave\">namespace catalog contents (dave)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#namespace-catalog-contents-dave\"></a></h2>\n<p>I'd initially assumed namespace-level catalogs would contain references to all contained entities and/or catalogs. But then merging namespace catalog-series from different SFDataRepos (with the same top-level namespace folders) could be tricky. Maybe not necessary? They'd help in discoverability, so maybe limiting namespace catalogs to \"contained\" named individuals could be okay... easier to merge. But if namespace dataset catalogs only refer to the namespaces and not contained elements, they wouldn't have to change very often if ever and they might look identical across different SFDataRepos anyhow. What exactly is going into these catalogs anyhow?</p>\n<h2 id=\"namespace-catalog-contents-chatgpt\">namespace catalog contents (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#namespace-catalog-contents-chatgpt\"></a></h2>\n<p>It sounds like you're grappling with the balance between <strong>discoverability</strong> and <strong>merge complexity</strong> for namespace catalogs. Here are a few points to consider regarding what's actually included in these catalogs and how they could be structured effectively:</p>\n<h3 id=\"potential-contents-of-namespace-level-catalogs\">Potential Contents of Namespace-Level Catalogs<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#potential-contents-of-namespace-level-catalogs\"></a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>References to Contained Named Individuals</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>simplest approach</strong> would be for namespace-level catalogs to contain references to <strong>all directly contained named individuals</strong>.</li>\n<li>This approach helps maintain <strong>clarity</strong> about what’s in the namespace and also makes merging from different <code>SFDataRepos</code> much simpler, as it focuses only on named individuals and doesn’t overreach into the other catalogs.</li>\n<li>Discoverability remains strong since the catalog still has a clear <strong>inventory of resources</strong> in the namespace, but the complexity of merging across different repositories is reduced.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Catalogs for Namespace-Level Discoverability</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If namespace catalogs include <strong>all contained catalogs or datasets</strong>, merging multiple <code>SFDataRepos</code> would indeed become tricky. Each <code>SFDataRepo</code> could have <strong>slightly divergent versions</strong> of the catalog, which means more work to reconcile during merges.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if catalogs at the namespace level only point to the <strong>namespace itself</strong>, rather than drilling down into contained elements, this would reduce merge complexity. The namespace-level catalog could then function like a <strong>pointer</strong> or an <strong>index</strong> to other catalogs, without needing frequent changes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Catalog Stability Across SFDataRepos</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By limiting the scope of namespace catalogs to <strong>namespace-level references</strong>—either to contained individuals or just namespace identifiers—they would need less frequent updates and could be <strong>consistent across multiple SFDataRepos</strong>.</li>\n<li>Essentially, these catalogs would act more like a <strong>stable entry point</strong> or reference hub, ensuring that anyone looking at the namespace can understand the structure without necessarily needing to see every entity or dataset listed exhaustively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Role in Discoverability</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To aid in <strong>discoverability</strong>, even a <strong>shallow catalog</strong> (only containing namespace-level references) could serve the purpose of <strong>navigation</strong> and <strong>linking</strong>. Users would still be able to navigate to the namespace and drill down further by following the contained individuals.</li>\n<li>If deeper discoverability is needed, this can be provided by the <strong>contained entity catalogs</strong> themselves, which can maintain their own listings of related resources, dataset series, and metadata.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"practical-example-for-catalog-content\">Practical Example for Catalog Content<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#practical-example-for-catalog-content\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Namespace-Level Catalogs</strong>: \n<ul>\n<li>Contain references like:\n<ul>\n<li><code>&#x3C;namespace1></code> references its own <strong>name, identifier</strong>, and <strong>general description</strong>.</li>\n<li>A <strong>list of named individuals</strong> within the namespace, allowing for easier lookup.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Exclude details about individual datasets or further catalogs contained within those individuals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Contained Entity-Level Catalogs</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Each <strong>named individual</strong> or <strong>contained entity</strong> can have its own catalog that is linked within the namespace.</li>\n<li>This would hold details on <strong>dataset series</strong>, <strong>versions</strong>, and any <strong>additional metadata</strong> required to fully understand or utilize that individual.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"summary-suggested-approach-for-namespace-catalogs\">Summary: Suggested Approach for Namespace Catalogs<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#summary-suggested-approach-for-namespace-catalogs\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limit the Catalog Scope</strong>: Keep namespace-level catalogs <strong>focused on the namespace itself</strong> and any <strong>directly contained named individuals</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain Catalog Stability</strong>: By not referencing contained catalogs or datasets explicitly, the namespace catalogs remain more stable across different <code>SFDataRepos</code>, reducing merge complexity.</li>\n<li><strong>Discoverability vs. Merge Complexity</strong>: This approach maintains a balance—providing useful <strong>discoverability</strong> without the overhead of merging complex catalog-series references from multiple sources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This setup makes merging across repositories easier while still providing enough detail at the namespace level to guide users and maintain useful navigation points throughout the RDF data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"we-could-also-just-reserve-discoverability-to-the-html-side-of-things-its-kinda-an-editorial-choice-what-you-make-discoverable-and-how\">We could also just reserve discoverability to the HTML side of things, it's kinda an editorial choice what you make discoverable and how.<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#we-could-also-just-reserve-discoverability-to-the-html-side-of-things-its-kinda-an-editorial-choice-what-you-make-discoverable-and-how\"></a></h2>\n<h2 id=\"html-discoverability-chatgpt\">html discoverability (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#html-discoverability-chatgpt\"></a></h2>\n<p>That's a great point—using the HTML side for discoverability gives you more <strong>editorial flexibility</strong> and avoids complicating the RDF structure with discoverability concerns. You can curate the user experience by designing how data is presented, what’s highlighted, and how different parts of the dataset are linked.</p>\n<p>This way, you could keep the RDF catalogs lean and focused on representing <strong>actual data relationships</strong> and dependencies, while the HTML layer serves as the more human-friendly navigational aid. It keeps the RDF data structured and clean, while letting the presentation layer do the work of discovery, which is often more adaptable and subjective.</p>\n<h2 id=\"latest-vs-current-dave\">latest vs current (dave)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#latest-vs-current-dave\"></a></h2>\n<p>thinking again about current/latest... maybe we call the editable latest version \"latest\" and reserve the \"current\" concept as a pointer within the catalog to the most recent published version. It brings back the PAV-ish concept of \"soon\" being different from current. That would allow applications to distinguish \"in-progress\" work from the last published version.</p>\n<h2 id=\"latest-vs-current-chatgpt\">latest vs current (chatgpt)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#latest-vs-current-chatgpt\"></a></h2>\n<p>That makes a lot of sense—using <strong>\"latest\"</strong> to represent the editable, in-progress version while reserving <strong>\"current\"</strong> as the most recent stable, published version adds clarity. This approach allows you to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clearly Separate Draft from Published Versions</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\"Latest\"</strong> becomes the work-in-progress, the draft version that may change frequently as editors make updates.</li>\n<li><strong>\"Current\"</strong> is the stable, published version that consumers or applications can rely on for consistency.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support Application-Level Version Control</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applications can distinguish between <strong>in-progress</strong> work (\"latest\") and the <strong>last stable state</strong> (\"current\").</li>\n<li>This also means users interacting with the data have a better understanding of the <strong>status</strong> of a dataset—whether it is under review/editing or it’s a final published version.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Align with PAV-Like Concepts</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This effectively reintroduces the PAV concept of \"soon\" or a pre-release state that isn’t the <strong>official current version</strong>.</li>\n<li>This separation can help you manage workflows more efficiently, making it clear when something is ready for release and when it's still a draft.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This distinction should make it easier for anyone using the data to understand what stage the information is in, improving the usability of your dataset versions. It also provides a much more straightforward way to handle ongoing edits without the confusion of having multiple \"current\" versions floating around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tell-me-all-about-next-and-the-implications-does-next-need-an-iri-there-should-be-a-predicate-for-unstable-files\">tell me all about next and the implications.
