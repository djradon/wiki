Think about the kinds of names you'd expect in different fantasy subgenres:</p>\n<pre><code>Epic fantasy might offer us Ethshea, Boarroth Moor, or Sulraven Peaks\n\nCosy fantasy might take us to Littlewindle, Haywine Wood, or The Frog and Fiddle Inn\n\nDark fantasy gives us Black Ruins, Tihos Lockhart, or Sorrowbrook Halls\n\nFairytale-inspired fantasy might lean into lyrical names like Wintershire, Maidenhill Glade, or The Moon and Tor Guild\n</code></pre>\n<p>Even before we know what these names refer to, we already have a sense of what kind of world we're stepping into. It matches the genre and the tone of your story, building trust, and saying to your readers; “you’re in the right place.”\nSetting the Tone with Sound and Shape</p>\n<p>Some names sound heavy. Others sound whimsical. Some feel elegant or brutal or haunting. Tone doesn’t just come from meaning, it comes from the way a name feels in your mouth.</p>\n<p>Compare these examples:</p>\n<pre><code>Graguldir vs. Tilbo\n\nBonedark Priory vs. Duckhold Crossing\n\nCastor Cornelius vs. Rinpy Stardoe\n</code></pre>\n<p>The spelling, rhythm, and choice of consonants all change the emotional feel. Harsh sounds like kr, gr, sk, and dr tend to feel aggressive or gritty. Soft endings, internal rhymes, and diminutives (like –ie or –kin) feel gentler and more playful.</p>\n<p>Even a completely invented name with no real-world meaning can suggest tone through its sound alone.</p>\n<p>Managing Reader Expectations</p>\n<p>The names you choose plant expectations in the reader’s mind, and you can use this to your advantage.</p>\n<p>If you introduce Grimdorn Foxcutter as a terrifying villain, the name backs it up. If that turns out to be the name of a cuddly innkeeper’s cat, that’s a deliberate misdirect. A contrast in tone used for humour, surprise, or charm.</p>\n<p>You can either lean into the expected, or you can twist it. Just make sure you're doing it with purpose. A name that doesn’t match the tone of your world, or that feels like it wandered in from another book entirely, risks confusing your reader or pulling them out of the story, so make sure you know why you’re using it,\nInstant Character Impressions</p>\n<p>A name isn’t just a label, it’s a little personality profile. Especially with characters, the name can be a shortcut to show status, culture, or mood.</p>\n<pre><code>Saber Steelclash gives us drama, legacy, and the expectation of battle.\n\nIlula Lockbramble feels warm, likely kind, possibly the village beekeeper.\n\nHexl sounds like someone who owns a concealed knife and a bad reputation.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also use naming to indicate a cultural system or status structure:</p>\n<pre><code>Surnames tied to place (Elnora of Kerfa)\n\nPatronymics (Maxwell son of Abe)\n\nHonorifics or earned titles (The Mountain-Caller, Countess Lorena)\n\nOne-word monikers for lone wanderers (Songwhite, Crow, Ghost)\n</code></pre>\n<p>By choosing carefully, you're giving the reader a little spark of understanding before you've even introduced the character properly.\nYour Naming Voice</p>\n<p>You don’t need to create a full conlang or an elaborate naming system (unless you want to, of course!), but you do want your names to feel like they belong in the same world.</p>\n<p>A city named Songdell will feel jarringly different if it’s next to towns called Yokodo, Hjelmeheim, and Tkro'tksik. That doesn't mean you can’t vary your style, but try to anchor it with a sense of internal logic. Do certain types of names come from certain regions? Are older cities more likely to be called Madderholde while newer settlements use nature-inspired names like Hawksrange?</p>\n<p>Even subtle patterns can make your world feel more immersive. And the great thing is, once you find your naming voice, your names will begin to reinforce each other without needing long explanations.\nA Quick Naming Tone Test</p>\n<p>Here’s a trick: when you invent a new name, say it aloud. Not just in your head, actually speak it. Then ask yourself:</p>\n<pre><code>Does this sound like it belongs in the kind of world I’m writing?\n\nWould this fit the tone of the story if the reader saw it out of context?\n\nDoes it sound like it fits with the places that surround it?\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also try swapping the name into a different world. If Malik Rougebane sounds ridiculous when taken out of your urban fantasy story and placed into a cosy fantasy tea shop, it’s probably doing its job correctly in terms of tone. That conflict means it’s carrying the right genre weight.</p>\n<p>So when you name your towns, your characters, your dark lords, and your roaming beasts, think about the genre you're writing. Think about the emotional tone you want the reader to feel. Think about whether you're aiming for awe, comfort, dread, or delight.</p>\n<p>Because the right name? It can open the door to your world with exactly the mood you want.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"CpS9sdQeO83XthdjEzqoL","title":"djradon's
