Whether consciously chosen or shaped by tradition, they reflect the values, fears, and stories a society holds dear. What a culture chooses to give a name to, and how they choose to name it, can tell you just as much about them as their politics, architecture, or magic system.</p>\n<p>Whether you're building a matriarchal seafaring empire or a tight-knit village in a forested glen, your naming conventions can say something powerful about how that world sees itself.\nWhat Your Culture Prioritises</p>\n<p>Names often reveal what a society celebrates or aspires to. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>A militaristic society might favour names that reflect strength, like Talon, Stonehold, or Strongblade.\n\nA culture with deep spiritual traditions might name children after saints, seasons, or celestial bodies, such as Celeste, Moonstorm, Dance-of-Spring.\n\nAn academic or arcane culture might lean toward long, multi-part names, with titles or syllables that signal mastery, like Kwenul Radiayth the II of the High Dynasty.\n</code></pre>\n<p>If a culture names people after animals, consider which creatures are respected and why. Are they named for predators, guardians, or clever survivors?</p>\n<p>If a culture names people after natural phenomena, think about what those elements symbolise. A storm name might honour power or unpredictability, while a name linked to rivers or rainfall might suggest life-giving roles, adaptability, or calm persistence. Fire names could belong to warriors or passionate reformers.</p>\n<p>These kind of associations aren’t just aesthetic, they reflect how the culture interprets the world around them and what traits they consider worthy of carrying into the next generation.\nTradition and Lineage</p>\n<p>Naming can also reflect how a culture sees time. Some societies look backwards, honouring the past, anchoring themselves to ancestors and family lines. Others look forward, naming with hope for the future.</p>\n<pre><code>Ancestral names: Children might be named after grandparents or important ancestors, either directly (Toren II) or through thematic echoes.\n\nVirtue names: Cultures that prize moral values may name children after ideals; Patience, Justice, Mercy, or their translated/invented forms.\n\nMythic names: Some names might be drawn from folklore, legends, or creation stories, subtly keeping the culture’s mythos alive.\n\nNaming rites: A child might be unnamed until a certain age or after a ritual. The name itself might change throughout life based on deeds, titles, or spiritual revelations.\n</code></pre>\n<p>These traditions can be either a source of cultural pride or the cause of conflict. A character who refuses to name their child after an ancestor might be making a statement that leads to them facing deep disapproval or even exclusion.\nNames You Shouldn’t Say</p>\n<p>Every culture has its silences.</p>\n<pre><code>Names that are taboo: perhaps the name of a fallen god, a cursed king, or a slain traitor.\n\nNames that are reserved: maybe only priests may speak them, or only in sacred spaces. They might be reserved for a particular social class, or specific lineage.\n\nNames that are forgotten on purpose: struck from history, buried by trauma or shame.\n</code></pre>\n<p>These absences are just as revealing as the names that are used. What your world doesn’t name, or refuses to name, is often loaded with meaning. Maybe there’s a mountain no one names. A city that once had a name, but it’s now only referred to as The Ashes.\nInsider Names vs. Outsider Names</p>\n<p>The names people use among themselves often differ from the names others use for them. This can create added layers of identity and perspective in your world:</p>\n<pre><code>A desert-dwelling people might call themselves The People of the Wind, but outsiders refer to them as Sandwalkers.\n\nA noble house might use a formal dynastic name (House Ilveran), while locals just call them the Ironroots.\n\nA place might have a ceremonial name, a trade name, and a nickname depending on who’s speaking.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is an active way that you can reveal the power dynamics in your world. Who gets to name who? Are certain names reclaimed? Is it offensive when outsiders use a shortened version of a sacred name?</p>\n<p>Names can become weapons, whether they are used to make one person feel unwelcome and belittled, or used to dehumanise an entire populace.\nHow Names are Spoken and Shared</p>\n<p>Even beyond meaning, the act of naming can reflect cultural behaviour. Are people expected to introduce themselves fully, or do they withhold their true names? Are names intimate, public, or sacred? Is a name something a person earns, rather than receives?</p>\n<p>In some cultures, your name might change as you grow, reflecting your role, status, or accomplishments. In others, nicknames might be used more often than formal names, showing affection, teasing, or community belonging.</p>\n<p>Think about what it means to know someone’s name in your world. Is it a sign of trust? Of danger? Of power?\nWorldbuilding through Contrast</p>\n<p>Sometimes the best way to highlight a culture’s values is by showing how different they are from another. In one kingdom, names might be bestowed by religious figures. In the neighbouring region, maybe names are chosen by the family matriarch.</p>\n<p>One culture might emphasise individuality, giving unique names that are never reused. Another might have dozens of children sharing the same name, with importance placed on lineage instead. A colonising empire might impose its own naming system on the cultures it conquers, erasing native identities.</p>\n<p>Names can be deeply political. They carry the weight of both identity and belonging, and sometimes, even resistance and rebellion.\nBuild from Within</p>\n<p>As always, you don’t need to invent an entire naming culture up front. But even a few thoughtful touches, like why a name is passed down, or why someone refuses to say a certain name, can deepen your world instantly.</p>\n<p>Start by asking:</p>\n<pre><code>What do these people value?\n\nWhat do they fear?\n\nWho do they remember?\n\nWho do they want to become?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Names may feel like small things, but in fantasy worldbuilding, they’re loaded with meaning. A name can tell you everything from how a person was born, to who they’re meant to be, or how they view themselves.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"CpS9sdQeO83XthdjEzqoL","title":"djradon's
