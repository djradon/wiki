And they’re particularly good at telling stories that reflect the digital age—stories about fractured realities, complex systems, and networked ways of being in the world.</li>\n<li>Murray became devoted to creating “incunabula,” a term meaning “swaddling clothes” that is used by book historians to describe awkward experiments produced just after the invention of the printing press.\n<ul>\n<li>She compares Myst, for instance, a seminal first-person adventure game from 1993, to the juvenilia of the Brontë sisters, who told stories to one another about tense dungeon-crawls in a “regressive, violent, overheated emotional universe.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>“walking simulator” was likely pejorative at first, rooted in a “misconception that there are two different categories, narrative and game, and you’re either one or the other.”</li>\n<li>there is \"a largely tortuous debate in game-studies circles between so-called ludologists <a href=\"/wiki/notes/kt0m0sxngg527mn2xoh7s2l\">Ludology</a> and narratologists: people who wanted to study games as abstract systems, on the one hand, and people who wanted to study them as narrative experiences on the other.\"\n<ul>\n<li>the prominent video-game critic <a href=\"/wiki/notes/r5y3bpskszo7gva6cj4kirp\">@ian-bogost</a>, a colleague of Murray’s at Georgia Tech, assailed her book one more time—without naming her or it directly—in a widely shared piece that was provocatively, if misleadingly, titled <a href=\"/wiki/notes/b1h0j78mhw4zmcvqtc8yr1f\">Video Games Are Better Without Stories</a>.</li>\n<li>ludologists want Tetris—or Candy Crush, or perhaps the screen itself—to be a refuge from narrative, she argues, because they’re embroiled in too much narrative already.</li>\n<li>For some, “objections to the possibility of deeply meaningful digital narrative forms” are rooted in “empty expressions of nostalgia for older media artifacts.” </li>\n<li>But for others it seems to be something else: a need to keep digital technology away from “the cultural and narrative dimensions of representation” altogether, as if it could remain a realm of pure function.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/bbtc442hi40u617ichcpwtx\">Hamlet on the Holodeck</a></li>\n<li><a
