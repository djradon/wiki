Qualities are numerical variables that can go up or down during play, and represent absolutely everything from inventory (how many bottles of laudanum are you carrying?) to skills (what is your Dangerous skill level?) to story progress (how far have you gotten in your relationship to your Aunt?). The StoryNexus tool implements QBN; so did <a href=\"https://emshort.wordpress.com/?s=varytale&#x26;submit=Search\">Varytale</a>, while that was still around, though in a hybrid form that allowed storylets themselves to contain CYOA-styled segments.\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/0eni5czizro3pwktyc8runu\">Storynexus</a> is hard on new authors because the content tends to be uninteresting until there are a fair number of storylets in the database, so it’s hard to feel like you’re really rolling until you’ve spent quite a bit of time in the tool.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/notes/qgcg6szf1i1quxxu0no6k6e\">Salience-based narrative</a> is a term I just made up to refer to interactive narratives that pick a bit of content out of a large pool depending on which content element is judged to be most applicable at the moment. Like QBN, this approach is agnostic about what kind of information matters: just as a quality in Fallen London could be pretty much anything, salience narrative can be tied to pretty much any testable information in the world state.\n<ul>\n<li><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"block-anchor anchor-heading icon-link\" id=\"^nt9g9zslhb88\" href=\"#^nt9g9zslhb88\"></a>relatively easy to build a rudimentary set of content with sensible, broad defaults, and then gradually add new, more salient content for individual situations. </li>\n<li>It’s not coincidental that both of the “salience-based” applications I mentioned are for triggering dialogue specifically, and that they’re handling a narrative layer transposed on an otherwise explorable environment.</li>\n<li>A much more extreme version of this is Doug Sharp’s <a href=\"/wiki/notes/r5rm40f194p75qwdo231t1q\">The King of Chicago</a> (you should really read this article if you haven’t — it’s fascinating). <em>The King of Chicago</em> is not just generating suitable dialogue but actually sequencing what should happen next in the story from a collection of possible scenes, based on everything that has occurred so far. It’s also using numerical rather than boolean state variables to measure salience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a
